title: Regional Socialism: A new economic model
subtitle: Or, how to negate the negative effects of profit while still using it as an economic feedback mechanism
author: Andrew M. Lyon
...

In the following, the blueprint for a socialist society will be outlined, in detail, that satisfies the following requirements:

- Partial economic planning happens on the regional level, via democratic process
- Planning is used to adjust high-level operations, not to micromanage the economy
- Regions are federated and able to collaborate with each other
- The means of production is community-owned (and thereby worker-owned)
- Wealth is automatically distributed based on hours worked and the difficulty of the work
- Personal property, such as owning a house or a car, is celebrated
- Human nature is accepted, not mutated into an unrealizable fantasy

This guide will be focused specifically on economic structure, carefully avoiding the topic of general governance. This is an economic guide, not an economic system horribly entangled into an opinionated political system (let's build one thing at a time). The ultimate goal is to see this vision realized within the confines of existing political and economic structures, not to languish as some utopian ideal.

Also, a best effort will be made to not reiterate -- for the trillionth time -- the inadequacies of capitalism (although there may be the occasional jab).

# Chapter 1: The problem with socialism

"What is socialism?" It's a question that's been asked over and over again, and usually the answers prompt only more questions. The idea is entirely fractured among different sects of people. Between those who self-identify as socialists, it means wildly different things. To many others, it means "anything that's not complete unregulated market-based capitalism."

Anyone who has read socialist literature will know the feeling of being bombarded less with technical theory or detailed plans, but more so with endless complaints against capitalism and endless "shoulds" and "coulds". The problem with socialism is that the goals are idealized concepts and not concrete definitions.

## Workers own the means of production

It sounds nice! The people who do a task are in full control of what they produce and how. What does this mean, though?

In the USSR, it meant a non-elected bureaucracy controlled the means of production, and given that the people had little say, wouldn't this mean that the workers did not own the means of production? Central planning is thought of by many to be synonymous with socialism (and why not, after you remove markets, how would an economy operate without planning?). However, central planning, when executed by a state bureaucracy not controlled by the population or the workers, is not really workers controlling their own destiny.

The idea of worker-owned production is itself a contentious idea in socialism. In market socialism, workers own their co-ops and compete against each other in a capitalist manner. In state socialism, the state owns the means of production and hires the workers to execute its will. In other forms of socialism, workers form guilds or unions and decide what to produce collectively.

I will outline a system where enterprises are community-owned and operated by the workers and operate in a mostly-decentralized manner that uses prices as an economic feedback system while not allowing capital hoarding.

## Production and markets

Many socialists are afraid of the term "market." It's usually used in conjunction with capitalism, and as such is a trigger-word for those who support Marxian ideas. However, a market doesn't necessarily mean the exploitation of workers, and it's an idea that's almost completely glossed over in socialist literature.

A market is a method and means of exchanging goods and services. In the case of socialism, the workers may own the means of production (for whatever nebulous definition various theories provide), but how are they to exchange their goods and services to other workers or consumers?

They do it via markets.

Socialism doesn't provide a model for working markets, though, and so various socialist factions are left to define this themselves, some of them based only on such loose concepts as "workers and consumers will form organizations and decide what to produce" or "we can't know how it will all function until the workers seize the means of production!" (what a grand way to form a new model of society...what could go wrong?). You may condemn this as a straw man argument, however I have come across many who think like this.

There has to be a way, however, to decide who builds what, and how it is distributed. To some, this involves large unions and interest groups deciding through spokespeople or democratically-elected leadership. To others, it means a supercomputer that tells every person exactly where they should be and exactly what they should be doing. Or perhaps a capitalist market with worker-owned co-ops.

I will define a working market system that neither requires top-down central planning, nor allows exploitation of the workers, all while still allowing entrepreneurship and innovation.

## Attaining socialism

How do we get our utopian socialist society? Even in the definition, "the workers seize the means of production," the word "seize" implies to take. It implies revolution, and this thinking can be fairly prevalent in socialist circles.

How, though, do you break old patterns and establish a new vision of society after fighting a bloody revolution? Who takes charge, and what kind of people are they? Even if you have a concrete plan of execution, how is it fully and completely realized in the chaos of rebuilding without corruption?

I would argue revolution, except in extreme cases, is an effective way to remove those in power, but almost never a viable means of attaining meaningful transformation.

Beyond just revolution, many have stated that socialism can only truly exist as a global phenomena. I would argue that if socialism cannot compete and win against a capitalist system after gaining a critical mass of support, then it is truly an inferior model. That's not to say the birth of a practicing socialist movement won't be extremely difficult -- even seemingly impossible at some points -- but in the end, I believe the productive capacity of those who do what they do because they love doing it will always win against those who do what they do because they will starve if they do not.

I will outline a method for achieving socialism within the confines of a capitalist system such that it can happen today, and not exist as some distant fantasy that requires mass killing.

## Chapter 2: Regional socialism: an overview

Let's be terse and start with a set of definitions and objectives:

- A region is any group of people who decide to associate with each other using this new economic system, generally within a geographic location. A region can be a city or county, or even a network of people within a capitalist-operating city.
- Production and its tools (factories, offices, machines, etc) are regionally/collectively-owned.
- A system-wide, electronic currency is used, and can be exchanged intra- and inter-region.
- Open-source software (named "Conductor") is used to manage the parameters of the regional economies, handle transfers of currency between entities, distribute payment to workers, facilitate purchasing between different companies, advertise job openings for companies, and act as an accounting tool for measuring the costs of regionally-operated companies. Regional capital pool(s) and regionally-operated companies will publish records of all transfer and purchasing for public review.
- Companies outside the regional-socialist economy will be allowed to participate in the buying and selling of products/services using the conductor network, allowing companies inside the economy to get the inputs to their production, and also sell products services to the outside world.
- Companies are the economic drivers of the region, and anybody can start a company.
- Companies are regionally-owned, worker-operated, and rent production equipment/facilities from the region at-cost. Companies are allowed to acquire any equipment or build any facilities they require (within local regulation).
- Company structure (hierarchy, collective, etc) is decided by workers, and decisions can be made collectively or delegated to managers (hiring, firing, spending decisions, etc).
- Loans/operating capital are facilitated by regional banks and credit unions (operating under the same rules as other worker-run regional companies) who charge interest based on the amount of risk of any venture they fund.
- Companies sell their products and services at whatever prices they see fit.
- If a company goes bankrupt, its assets are owned by its creditors with the caveat that the region gets right of first refusal on purchasing reclaimed assets from creditors (such as office buildings, equipment, etc).
- Company profits cannot be distributed to workers. Profits must be used to hire more workers or to purchase more inputs to production. Profits-at-rest are taxed by a regionally-defined amount, incentivizing reinvestment, and redistributing unspent profit to the community.
- Companies can hire who they choose (within local/state/federal regulatory restrictions).
- Workers are paid an hourly rate based on productivity, training required, regional need, physical/mental stress, etc (productivity being decided by peers and/or industry standards if measurable, and the others being regionally-decided). Productivity rate acts to set a range of wages for each occupation, and the amount of range is regionally-decided.
- Payment is automatically deducted from the company capital pool and transferred to workers hourly.
- All worker income is taxed by a regionally-defined amount.
- All sales are taxed by a regionally-defined amount.
- Global (or, external) trade happens via the Conductor system or, if needed products/goods are unavailable, regional companies that operate on the Conductor network and import/export goods (as well as handle returns).
- K-12 education is set up as a regionally-operated company (thus all purchasing and funds are transparent) and fully subsidized. Teachers, administrators, and maintenance staff are payed under the same guidelines as other regional companies (regionally-set wages).
- Colleges and trade schools are regionally-operated and subsidized. Students pay a (regionally-decided) percentage of the operational cost of the school they attend while they are enrolled.
- Private schools are set up as non-subsidized regional companies and operate under the same rules of profit as other regional companies.
- Regionally-owned colleges/trade schools are wait-listed (via Conductor) favoring new students or those who have not been to school in N years (N being decided regionally). Wait-listing allows determining demand (to hire more teachers or expand facilities), as well as balancing the need for re-training new careers with excessive and unnecessary schooling.
- Apartments are regionally-owned and rented out at-cost, or some regionally-decided percentage above cost (cost being property tax, maintenance, and administration). Housing is wait-listed (via software), allowing collective measure of demand.
- Home ownership is not restricted or managed by the region, although if more regional housing is desired, homes may be purchased by the region and rented out at-cost (or a regionally-decided percentage above-cost).
- Hospitals are regionally-owned and subsidized. Patients pay a (regionally-decided) percentage of visits/procedures. Pricing is at-cost. Private hospitals are also allowed and set up as regional companies.
- All members of the region will be paid a (regionally-decided) monthly stipend out of the region's capital pool (UBI).

Probably the most important thing to note here is that (non regionally-operated) companies can extract profit from the products they sell, but they can only use that profit to expand production (via hiring, buying more inputs to production) or make production more efficient (automating various aspects of production, buying more efficient machinery). More details on this in the "Company profits" section below.

Another thing you may notice is that a lot of things happen in the above model as if by clockwork (workers are paid hourly from the company pool, products and jobs are listed, etc). The goal of this model of socialism is not to just provide a blueprint, but to actually provide the open-source software that will be used as the backbone of its functioning. Things like tracking workers' hours, buying and selling products and services, job listings, etc will all be tracked in this distributed software system that lets not only people participating in a region engage in commerce, but also lets people in different regions engage via a federated network. In other words, someone from the San Francisco region would be able to see job listings in the New York region, and a Houston region company can see and buy products from a Minneapolis region company.

Because it tracks work hours (along with wages) and inputs (products bought needed to supply a company) of regionally-owned companies (hospitals, schools, etc), it can account for exactly how much things cost to run, and can provide services to their customers at-cost.

Let's tackle a few key concepts.

## Regions

Why the regional approach? It comes down to human nature. Nobody likes someone else telling them how to live their life. However, it's usually much worse when the person doing so lives far away and has no idea what life is like for people here.

Economic decisions should reflect the needs of communities, not some state planning board from some distant land. Regions are set up such that people participating in the region set the parameters of their own economy to suit their needs.

Beyond this acknowledgment of human nature, however, is another reason for regionality: it allows the growth of federated socialist units that share wealth and resources as they grow. The entire idea of a region is that it connects those who participate in it while inside the confines of a capitalist system, while allowing trade and relations to other regions.

Regions are the geographically-separated pockets of ever-growing socialist economies. This locality of them, and their ability to function with only a handful of people in them, is the very means by which the movement will eventually spread and grow.

## Company profits

Companies can have profit, and can buy and sell things at will. So did we just invent market socialism?

The answer is no, because a) the means of production are regionally/community-owned and b) the workers are paid based on regionally-decided parameters (the region decides "Teachers get $50/hr, doctors get $40/hr, shopkeepers get $20/hr, etc"). The only motives for a company's profit are to a) grow the company and hire more workers and b) invest in making the company more efficient.

Capitalists often crow about how private property and the free exchange of capital allows reinvestment into enterprise (although they will defend a company laying off workers and buying back their own shares after receiving an enormous tax break). Well here, we make this function explicit and define profit as only useful to a business for paying the workforce and reinvesting into the business.

Profit has another use here, though. It's the feedback mechanism that drives the economy. In essence, it forgoes the need for detailed economic planning. You can measure a company's inputs and outputs and measure consumer satisfaction and match supply exactly with demand by tracking every single possible economic variable until you're blue in the face, or you can relegate that to the people who are actually running the production. In essence, profit becomes the measure of an enterprise's economic success. You are giving the workers the means to produce, the freedom to produce how they see fit, and the ability to innovate and derive profit not for personal gain but for the profit of the common good.

Profit is what keeps a central planner in some bureaucratic office from coming by one day and telling the workers that they aren't meeting the needs of society. It lets a company know whether the value of the products it creates are enough to pay for the labor (as it is valued by the community) going into those products. It acts as a signal of customer satisfaction. It creates a drive to improve efficiency without the temptation to pocket the surplus value.

Many socialists might argue that markets and profits create waste and are antithetical to the actual needs of society. For instance, how much human labor is spent in advertising to get consumers to buy things they don't need? The answer to this is, of course, to lower the wages for people in the advertising industry. Because wages are now explicitly set as a controlled economic variable, the region can decide which activities it finds useful and which it does not. In addition, because profits cannot be distributed personally, the endless "race to the bottom" one finds in capitalism would be controlled not just by fixed wages, but also by the various restrictions on how profit is used. Would this fix all consumerism? Likely, not. However, there is a suspicious and worrying amount of overlap between "production meeting people's needs" and a central planning board deciding that only certain styles of glasses frames will be produced.

Regional socialism will not solve climate change or consumerism, but it aims to temper the things that cause them.

## Open-source Software ("Conductor")

Those who opt-in to regional socialism will also be opting to use the software, named "Conductor," that manages various aspects of the economy. This software will be open-source and available to the public for review and for (controlled) modification. The database it operates on will be publicly viewable and operated under the conditions of absolute transparency (although all balances and transactions will be private, except for regionally-operated companies).

The software defines the many operations that can take place in the economy. It tracks the number of worker hours. It automates the transfer of company profits to worker accounts, the repayment of loans from companies to banks/credit unions, and tenant payments to regional apartments. It facilitates purchasing via a payment and product network. It allows management of specific attributes such as hourly wages, profit-at-rest taxation levels, etc. It has various levels of permissions control, such that only specific people can do specific tasks, sometimes requiring approval from multiple people to perform an action.

The purpose of Conductor is not just to enforce policies, but to lower the barrier to entry for many tasks people and companies will be performing on a constant basis. And beyond that, its goal is to be so good at what it does, that to not use it isn't just inconvenient, it's expensive.

The platform will exist as a set of tools to make regional socialism cheaper to operate.

## Currency

Currency is a touchy subject in socialism. Are people paid in dollars? In labor tokens? If not, how do consumers purchase things, and how to workers buy the inputs to their production process?

In regional socialism, a currency is defined and used. It will be named CCT, or "Chucky-Cheese tokens." Just kidding. For our purposes, we will just use Regional-Socialist Credits ("RSC"). This currency will be transferable within regions and between regions. The currency itself will be completely electronic and automatically managed by the Conductor system.

The currency is set up such that direct transfers between:

- Any two people are allowed (allowing purchase of second-hand products)
- A person and a company are prohibited (products can be purchased via Conductor instead)
- A company and another company are prohibited (inputs to production are purchased via Conductor)

It may seem draconian to limit transactions this way, however it ensures that:

- Companies spend excess profit on reinvestment, hiring, or purchasing inputs to their production instead of payouts
- Company profits must come from product sales or services, thus adding value to society
- Regionally-operated companies (schools, hospitals, etc) are completely transparent, allowing to provide services at-cost

Instead of direct transfers, Conductor provides various actions that facilitate the flow of RSC:

- A person or company purchasing a product or service
- A person or company paying rent on regional housing or production equipment
- A bank or credit union loaning capital to a person (for purchasing a home or car) or company
- A person or company paying back a loan
- A region pooling funds with other regions to pay for common infrastructure or cross-regional services (such as public transit)

Direct transfers between two people is allowed. And why not...they earned the money, they should be able to do what they wish with it. The rationale behind prohibiting direct transfers between people is to limit secondary markets, but secondary markets will form whether using the accepted currency or not. Why not accept this, instead of trying to control it?

After all, the goal of this economic system is not to force people to do things a certain way, but to make it easy and cheap to do things in the accepted fashion, all while accepting human nature. If someone wants to buy old cars and sell them at a profit, she can certainly do so, but she might find that working for a mechanic company instead will pay more.

## Chapter 3: Function of regions

Regions are the economic containers of regional socialism. They are managed by the people participating in the region, and define and automate various aspects of the economy.

Management of regional parameters and operations can be decided by direct democratic process, through elected representatives, or by various other methods. The exact process for governing regions won't be defined here, and will likely vary from region to region.

## Regional parameters

The regional parameters define various aspects for how the economy will work within the region. They will be defined in the Conductor system and managed either directly by the region's participants or by elected representatives.

All regional parameters will always be publicly available for review by any member of the region. The full list of regional parameters is as follows:

- Worker hourly wages (more on how this is defined in Chapter 4)
- Wage reduction dampening rate/delay
- Productivity rate value range (eg, between 0.5 and 1.5, or 0.8 and 1.2, etc)
- Sales tax percentage
- Income tax percentage
- Profits-at-rest taxation delay and percentage
- Healthcare subsidization
- Higher education subsidization
- Higher education wait-list prioritization
- Percentage above-cost to charge for apartments (essentially an apartment tax)
- Percentage above-cost to charge for duplex and house rental (essentially a house-rental tax)
- UBI monthly payment amounts

## Regionally-operated companies

The region will operate a small amount of various types of companies. The main candidates for regional operation are:

- Housing
- Healthcare
- Education

The idea is that the region will trend toward operating companies where profit-seeking is detrimental to society as a whole.

All accounting happens through Conductor, allowing detailed information on costs of running the company. This makes it easy to offer services at-cost (or some percentage of cost, with the region subsidizing the difference). It also allows ultimate transparency: any regional member can view the accounting of any regionally-operated company.

Members of the region can appoint a director or board of directors for each regional company. So while regionally-operated companies are not beholden to the rule of profit, they will still be accountable to members of the region.

Regionally-operated companies are not necessarily restricted to regional members. For instance, if a region has excess space in an apartment complex, it may rent out the rooms to non-regional members at market rate (instead of at-cost). Of course, when the market-rate tenants find out their neighbors are paying significantly lower rents, they may decide to become members.

## Capital

Regional taxation (income, sales, profits-at-rest) all generates regional income and is put into the region's capital pool. What this capital is spent on will also be regionally-decided. Should healthcare be subsidized? Should sales tax be lowered? Members can adjust the parameters of the economy to tune the growth of the capital pool.

Regional capital, like regionally-operated companies, operates under full transparency. Any member of the region can see exactly how much is in the capital pool now and at all points in history. Being able to see historical data allows charting and more long-term decision making.

The transparency of the capital pool and regionally-operated companies allows making highly informed decisions on just how much the region should subsidize or tax various operations. For instance, if the members of a region know it costs $4M a month to operate the regional hospital, they know it will cost $3M a month out of the capital pool to subsidize 75% of healthcare.

## Federation

While many parameters of the economy are regionally-defined, regions are able to engage in commerce and share much of their information via federation. For instance job postings, wages, purchasing of products and services, education, and housing will all be advertised on the federated network shared by connected regions.

This allows companies and people in various regions to engage in commerce with each other without barriers. It also allows someone to find a region that has the highest wages for work they might be interested in, and to see if in-region housing is available there.

Federation of regions allows transparency and freedom of movement.

## Chapter 4: Companies, workers, and wages

Companies are started by region members and operated by their workers. They are autonomous economic units that can set prices for their products and services however they see fit, as long as their income matches the inputs to their production (including regionally-defined wages).

## Profit

Companies can make profit. The difference with market capitalism, however, is that company profit cannot be arbitrarily distributed to workers. Profit must be spent, via the Conductor system, on more inputs to production, hiring more workers, or buying products or services to make production more efficient. Profits which sit too long (using FIFO accounting) in a company's capital pool are taxed at a regionally-defined rate.

This separation of profit from the workers ensures a few things:

- Capital is distributed based on regional wages, not based on arbitrary market forces
- Profit is used mainly as an economic feedback mechanism

Over time, this mechanism redistributes capital based on regionally-decided wages. There is no longer a scenario where an absentee-owner gets rich while the workers get paid poverty wages.

Profit as a feedback mechanism is also important. It's extremely difficult to efficiently allocate resources and match supply with demand using any form of economic planning. On top of questions of planning, you get into situations where perhaps society's needs are met (food, shelter, clothing) but certain wants are completely unmet. You could construct a planned economy based on Marx's use-values, but who determines use-values? Who determines what is important or needed and what isn't?

Profit answers all these questions. It allows economic planning in a purely-decentralized manner, allocating resources to exactly where society desires them. Further, splitting the profit from from capital distribution allows profit to be used as an economic feedback mechanism without distributing wealth in absurdly uneven ways. Because profit can only be used for reinvestment and not personal gain, the endless drive for excess profit is significantly reduced along with the negative side-effects that come with it (such as pollution and regulatory capture).

This method of economics

- foregoes the need for central or detailed planning
- tames profit-driven greed and reduces pressure for negative externalities (such as pollution)
- distributes wealth to workers based on the value and amount of work they do
- incentivizes hiring and reinvestment into production
- allows consumers to individually decide what goods and services they deem useful

Regional socialism takes the good aspects of markets (decentralized planning using profit as feedback) and merges them with sane wealth distribution mechanisms (no absentee ownership, means of production commonly owned, workers are paid regionally-set wages) while severely dampening the negative side-effects of profit-driven culture.

## Ownership

Companies are all regionally-owned. It's important to distinguish between regionally-owned and regionally-operated. Regionally-operated companies are run by a director or a board of directors that is appointed by members of the region. They are run with transparent accounting and often are subsidized in some manner by the region's capital pool.

All other companies are worker-operated. Worker-operated companies are still regionally-owned, but the region has no direct control over a company's existence, operation, or capital pool. All these things are controlled by the workers of a company.

All companies in the region are owned by the region, and the region itself is owned by its members. Therefor, every member is a part owner of every regional company. This ownership does not afford members any kind of special control over specific companies they are not employees of, but does allow making collective decisions on matters that affect the region as a whole (for instance when to buy or sell housing, office building, various machinery for production, etc).

It's important to mention legality and ownership. In the final chapter, a method of birthing regional socialism is described. It will likely be set up as a co-op structure that is a legal entity which owns the companies operating inside of it. In the event of a regional company acting in an illegal manner, the region may investigate and decide whether or not to close the company and/or fire the workers involved from the co-op.

Under this co-op structure, companies that reach a particular number of employees may be spun off as subsidiary companies to act as a legal barrier to protect the co-op while still maintaining regional control of the company.

## Wages and wage calculations

Worker wages are set by the members of the region. This is more complicated than it seems. There are a number of different factors that affect wages, and a number of different categories that wages fall under.

For instance, a company might have a CEO, and a region might set the CEO wage to $40/hour. Now all CEOs make $40/hour. However, let's say that a region decides to invest in its growing aeronautics industry. It wants the CEO of an aeronautics firm to make more than the CEO of a towing company, but a data-entry clerk at the aeronautics firm should make the same wage as a data-entry clerk at the towing company. Not so simple!

Let's imagine another situation. A region has a doctor shortage, so raises the wages for doctors, which causes doctors to move into the region to fill the available positions. Great! However, doctors keep moving in to try to get jobs. Too many doctors! The region decides to lower the doctor wage back to a previous rate to stop the influx. Does this mean the current doctors we worked hard to get will leave for greener pastures? Not necessarily. Wage reductions for existing workers can be handled such that they are delayed and/or are reduced linearly (decayed) over a regionally-set amount of time. The amount of delay (days until the wage starts changing) and rate of decay (days until the new wage takes full effect, not counting delay) are regionally-set on a per-reduction basis. New workers who take on these jobs will immediately get the new lower wages, and workers who had the higher paying jobs before will have some amount of delay and slow decline before the wage reductions take full effect (and it's important to note that the delay can be set arbitrarily high to effectively lock in previous wages). New downward changes to wages will essentially override the previous delay/decay parameters, but the new parameters will be applied to the wage at its current rate of decay. In other words, delay and decay only act to change the current wage, and cannot arbitrarily set the wage lower (unless delay and decay are both set to 0, which would force an immediate wage reduction).

Wages are broken out into two categories: occupation and industry. Every occupation is part of an industry, usually as a function of the company the occupation exists in. For instance a lawyer at a bank would be a lawyer by occupation in the finance industry. Let's look at the full calculation for a wage:

```
base_wage = STARTING_WAGE *
  (1 + (industry.need * occupation.industry_weight)) *
  (1 + occupation.skill) *
  (1 + occupation.need) *
  (1 + occupation.stress) *
  (1 + occupation.danger)
final_wage = base_wage +
  ((2 * (worker.productivity -- 0.5)) * occupation.productivity_rage * base_wage)
```

Every industry has a need parameter which defines how much a region values that industry, and each occupation has a number of parameters that affect the overall hourly rate. This lets a region adjust wages both for an entire industry and for individual occupations. This is a list of occupational parameters:

- Industry weight: A value between 0 and 1 that sets how much this occupation is affected by the corresponding industry's need. A data entry occupation that takes minimal training might have this value set close to 0 (so data entry in finance makes the same as data entry in education), and a lawyer might have it set higher (so if the region values the healthcare industry more than advertising, a lawyer in healthcare would make somewhat more than a lawyer in advertising).
- Need: A value between 0 and 1 that shows how much a region values this particular occupation. For instance, if there is a shortage of accountants, this value might go up, and if there is a surplus, it might go down.
- Skill: A value between 0 and 1 that determines the amount of skill an occupation has. This should ideally take into account the number of years of training a profession takes (as well as difficulty of training).
- Stress: A value between 0 and 1 that determines the physical and mental stress an occupation has. A dog walker would probably be 0. A surgeon would probably be close to 1.
- Danger: A value between 0 and 1 that sets the physical danger of an occupation. A teacher might be close to 0, and a construction worker might be close to 1.
- Productivity range: A value between 0 and 1 that sets the percentage of the base wage the wage can change given a worker's productivity level. In other words, with a base wage of $100/hr and a productivity range of 0.2 (or, 20%), the wage can fluctuate between $80 (at a productivity level of 0.0) and $120 (at a productivity level of 1.0). At a productivity level of 0.5, the base wage remains unchanged ($100).

It's important to note that many of these parameters may be set once and only adjusted infrequently. Need will probably be adjusted the most, and things like skill and danger may be adjusted infrequently. However, if the miner occupation has a high danger level, the introduction of a machine that lets the miner do their job remotely would significantly reduce the danger, and the danger level would be adjusted. A robotic-assist arm may reduce the stress level of surgeons quite a bit.

A worker's productivity level is set by the company she works for. If a worker is the only employee of a company, they can set their own productivity rate arbitrarily. In a larger company, productivity rates would likely be set by peer or managerial review. The process of how productivity rates are set for each worker is left up to the companies and their workers.

Productivity level along with productivity rate allows creating some range of wages within the same occupation. This allows companies a certain level of autonomy in setting their own wages while at the same time keeping the wishes of the community as a whole in mind. The goal of this system is to balance the needs of the overall region while still giving companies a certain level of control.

## Chapter 5: Banking and investment

WIP

Banking in regional socialism will work much like it does in the market system. Companies will get loans from regional banks and credit unions. Loan interest rates will reflect the risk of the business endeavor. If a company goes bankrupt, the bank will seize its remaining assets and sell them. The only difference is that regionally banks must give right of first refusal of all purchases to the region. This is to allow the region to purchase things like building and equipment that the company bought while it was operational.

Companies that choose to seek financing from banks outside the regional economy must be set up as subsidiaries to protect the region's assets from seizure. This will likely be a more intricate process than seeking capital from within the region, although it's possible this could be streamlined enough to be fairly cheap for both the region itself and the entrepreneur (who would be responsible for all filing fees).

Investment via private equity will be impossible, because a company has no shares to sell (the region owns the companies). That's not to say, however, 

## Chapter 6: Housing

A goal of regional socialism is to provide housing to members of the region at-cost. The idea is to attract people outside the regional economy to join and participate in the economy by providing housing at a much cheaper rate than the outside. Even if someone in the regional economy makes less money doing their job than they did outside in the capitalist world, housing (and possibly other services) would be much cheaper inside the economy and would offset the difference.

Regionally-owned housing will likely be limited to mainly apartments, however there is no reason why the region can't buy condos, duplexes, and single-family homes and rent them out as well. Living in more luxurious housing would likely come with a regionally-defined (and possibly per-property) housing tax percent above the at-cost value of the property's local taxes and maintenance.

In essence, the region will be a landlord who only raises rent if the underlying costs of the property go up. Property management is handled by a regionally-operated company with an elected director or board of directors.

## At-cost apartments

Apartment buildings owned by the region will use Conductor for all purchasing and wage payments, giving a strict and transparent accounting of all expenses and income. This will allow setting rents for apartments (according to square footage of the apartment's floor plan) to a level such that if all units are occupied, total rent income will be slightly higher than the average monthly costs of property tax, maintenance personnel and supplies, water, and garbage collection. Electricity and natural gas will be the responsibility of each tenant, and billed separately by the local power company (which may or may not be within the regional economy).

## Home purchasing

Regional socialism -- while possibly engaging in the purchasing of condos, duplexes, and single-family homes at its own will -- takes no position on its members buying or selling property inside or outside the geographical region. While property speculation will be a method of generating personal profit, the complications of attempting to regulate this market are much too numerous and would likely stifle participation.

It is hoped that the region buying up properties and setting rents fairly will have a calming effect on the surrounding housing markets, reducing the amount of profit that real estate speculation can deliver.

As with other secondary markets, regional socialism takes a passive stance, even with items as large as property. That said, as with other secondary markets, individuals will be competing with regional socialism and may find it more profitable to operate in the primary markets rather than secondary.

## Chapter 11: The start and growth of a socialist economy

Now that we have defined a plan for how our regional socialist economies operate, we need to have a plan for breathing life into the idea.

The plan is to create an ever-expanding "zone" of regional socialism starting with a core group of participants and moving out from there. Likely, the movement would start with one zone and would be set up legally as a co-op: all members of the co-op equally own all assets of the co-op. An articles of incorporation is written up such that:

- Anybody can join the co-op, and can do so without any transfer of assets to the co-op.
- All members of the co-op equally share ownership over all assets.
- All members of the co-op use the Conductor software and RSC currency for intra-co-op commerce.
- The RSC and USD exchange rate will be 1:1 initially to limit confusion with members (and this exchange rate may likely persist), although exchange rate can be set regionally. The co-op will always be able to back 1 RSC with 1 USD and vice versa (via reserves).
- Members can convert their personally-owned RSC to USD (and back again) at any time.
- Conductor software is kept up-to-date by all members.
- Members can leave the co-op at any time, but cannot remove any non-earned assets from the co-op ownership.
- (WIP) Co-op management is initially run by an unelected board of tyrants.
- Co-ops will have provisions to allow it to split, along with transfer of assets, into a new region based on various criteria. This might include splitting on various physical regions (city/county lines) or to avoid anti-trust disputes.

The goal is to create a legal entity that, through a process of acquiring profitable businesses, amasses an ever-growing pool of capital that allows it to expand and encompass a wide range of products and services. Ultimately, the goal is to reach a critical mass where almost anything needed by the members can be found within the co-op's internal economy, and anything that cannot be found within the co-ops's economy can be easily purchased outside of the economy (by spending RSC).

Counterpoint: how will "members" get paid in RSC if they are employees of the co-op? Wouldn't they require payment in USD? If so, that would break Conductor's model of controlling the (internal) flow of the currency.

## Phase 1 -- Initial stages and volunteer participation

WIP

Members of the co-op at this stage are dedicated to a socialist cause, and willing to work hard for this cause. They will set themselves up as "companies" in Conductor, and any income they derive outside of Conductor as a company will be converted to RSC and added to their company's profits, from which they can pay themselves an hourly rate the same as their capitalist rate (which will be taxed at some minimal amount). This income tax is what will feed the co-op's capital pool.

At this stage, Conductor will allow setting hourly rates per-company/per-worker, and members will be allowed to set the number of hours they worked manually (essentially emptying their company profit pool after each pay period). In an ideal world, hourly rates would be per-profession and decided democratically, and worker hours would be tracked by automated systems, but this would be suicidal in early stages. The survival of the system at this stage requires a near 1:1 match between capitalist wages and worker payment. If wages were to be equalized when the regional capital pool was too small and the products/services provided within the region were limited, the members making more would subsidize the ones making less, until the ones making more went bankrupt, and then all is lost. This stage is not set up to tackle income inequality.

After being paid by their company, members will be able to convert some or all of their RSC income back to USD automatically so they can participate with little-to-no effort.

The Conductor software will be tested and expanded as the members use it for the early stage purposes.

This stage is about controlled membership, testing, and refinement.

## Phase 2 -- Steady membership growth

WIP

Next, the region will seek out new members willing to donate a portion of their income and participate in the co-op. Hourly rates will still be highly-controlled at this rate. The security, growth, and scalability of the network will be tested.

Additionally, members will begin to advertise the services they can provide via Conductor. Members will be able to engage in commerce in-network.

A key point of this stage is to start working on automated solutions that bridge the region/capitalist barrier. For instance, a company that mirrors products on Amazon and allows purchasing via RSC (at-cost) would encourage spending of personal funds in-network, without converting to USD first. The more companies/services that could provide bridges to the surrounding capitalist system, the better.

This would be the beginning of the very early stages of economic growth, and intra-region commerce.

## Phase 3 -- Business acquisition and expansion of products/services

As the regional capital pool and membership grows, the co-op will encourage people to start engaging in Conductor-based commerce. This could be done by adjusting exchange rates such that $1 USD buys $1.05 RSC, creating an incentive for intra-region production.

As the capital pool grows via member taxation and increasing services offered, the co-op will start to turn toward acquisition of local businesses. The leadership of the co-op will plan and facilitate a series of acquisitions, out of the regional capital pool, of businesses that will support economic growth. This may be facilitated through slow and natural growth, or through capital injection from sympathetic individuals or nations.

After buying a business, the employees are offered membership in the co-op, and will be given the same wages to their previous position. Businesses bought will be required to use the Conductor system to publish job posting and products and for co-op-related business, however can use old systems when ordering products/services outside the collective (if there is no bridge-company providing those products). Businesses would be trained on collective ownership and be encouraged to set up their own internal structure. The idea is eventually the co-op would expand enough that businesses can conduct much of their transactions inside the economy and not externally.

The more businesses and assets the co-op owns, the more intra-co-op business can be conducted, providing a large network of products and services to members. Critical mass for participation is reached such that people outside the co-op will seek membership in order to gain access to job listings and in-region benefits.

## Phase 4 -- Basic needs

When the co-op reaches this point, it now has a steady source of capital inputs via co-op-owned businesses doing extra-region business, and intra-region business starts to be self-sustaining as a wealth of regional products and services grows. As the inputs outweigh the outputs, the growth of the co-op becomes more natural. The awkward, messy, and difficult process of gaining critical mass is complete. As growth of the regional capital pool happens, the co-op now seeks to acquire the means to provide basic needs.

The most important basic need at this point is housing. The co-op will begin to buy apartment complexes from its regional capital pool. Once housing is secured, and there is enough commerce within the region to support basic needs such as food, the wages of workers can start to be decided democratically instead of being approximations of the capitalist system from which they were originally derived.

There are still some expensive externalities, such as health care, which will not be met. The co-op will provide the option to "hire" members who conduct some percentage of their commerce in-region and provide a them group health insurance policy. This is in lieu of purchasing hospitals, which although they would be attractive targets for acquisition, would be prohibitively expensive.

## Phase 5 -- Natural growth and final economic stage

Once basic needs are met (and in the previous stage they will almost certainly be just that...basic) the regional socialism model will take over. All vestigial remnants of capitalist-wages will be abolished, and workers will be paid their wages according to their profession and productivity, via democratic decision within the co-op.

Regionally-owned facilities (schools, hospitals, commercial space, etc) would be provided at-cost. All worker wages and materials that run these facilities would be a matter of public record in Conductor, allowing fully-transparent public services. The region can decide how much of hospital costs or education costs it wants to subsidize.

Regional inventory (factories, commercial space, machinery, trucks for shipping, etc) would be queryable via Conductor and a matter of public record. Companies needing machinery (or other means of production) not provided by the region can petition the regional inventory collective for the funds to purchase, and if the company goes bankrupt, that equipment will be returned to the collective.

Growth at this point would be a natural progression. Purchase of land and construction of more housing and regionally-owned facilities would be decided democratically. Workers attracted by the success of the regional socialist economic model will no longer need artificial incentives to join.

Conductor's systems are fully matured and scale to support the economy running on top of it.

## Phase 6 -- Spread

The co-op has proven itself successful. Not just as a legal entity, but as a method of ushering in socialism within the confines of a hostile economic system.

Now, if it hasn't happened already, co-op delegates are sent to other municipalities and work to set up new co-ops. Because of the federated nature of regions, newly created regions will have many less growing pains as the first one: processes will be in place, incorporation papers will already exist, legal precedents will be set, software and networks will be fully matured, a wealth of products and services will be available.

And beyond all of this, it is hoped that the general public will begin to see the harmony in handing the production of society over to those who produce, instead of those who seek to extract personal gain at the expense of others.

## Phase 7 -- Complete integration

Once public opinion has shifted, and "socialism" is no longer a dirty word, and a number of co-ops have operated successfully for years (likely, many years), then is the time for the co-ops to dissolve and hand control of the assets and the economy to the local municipalities they were born out of.

There will still likely be capitalist pockets in each region, some even quite large, at this point. However, over time, their labor pool will likely shrink, forcing them to raise wages or throw up their arms in defeat, being slowly swallowed up.

The support for capitalism will have, at least in this physical region, withered to the point that the co-op is no longer needed as a legal shield to protect against corruption. The processes of transparency, public accountability, and pride in one's labor will supersede the level of greed that would be needed to corrupt the system. That's not to say corruption will wither away, however it will not be allowed to reach the critical mass needed to overturn the socialist economy and return to capitalism.

Much like you seldom hear the call for the return to feudalism, so will the call for capitalism slowly fade.
