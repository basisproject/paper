# Chapter 3: Companies

Companies are a core concept of the system. They define networks of people within the greater Basis network that have common purpose. This common purpose might be productive in nature, it might be based on shared resources like housing or farm land, or it might be some mix of the two.

## Organization

A company is defined as a grouping of individual members, companies, and resources. A company might have only individual members, or all of its members might be other companies. It could be a mix.

The relations defined here allow for any number of general organizations or groups of organizations that might be needed for members. They might want a separate companies for housing and commercial property within their region, or they might want one large company in stewardship of all the resources in that region. They might want companies that mirror the current city, county, and state they live in. Whatever arrangements are used depend entirely on the participants, and members are free to arrange, re-arrange, enter, and exit these structures however they see fit.

It's important to note that membership in a company could be based on rules defined and enforced by the members of that company (who would have to approve each new member), or they may be automatic such that members are defined by those in-use of the company's resources which might be the case for housing companies.

## Resource stewardship

Companies can be in stewardship of network-owned resources, allowing the members of that company (whether individual or other companies) use of those resources. How stewardship is determined is covered in Chapter 7 ("Shared resource management").

What's important though is that companies are links between individual members, other companies, and network resources. The ultimate goal is to no longer mediate these relationships through markets, but rather create relations directly between resources and the people who use them, preferring self-management over profits and private ownership.

## Cost tracking

Companies are all cost tracking entities. If they order products, services, or resources from other companies (or the market) the costs of those interactions are incorporated into their costs.

For instance, if a company is steward to an apartment complex, it would need to cover the cost of maintenance, taxes, and insurance. It could do this by taxing the members of that company or by passing the costs through directly to those in-use of the apartment building. However, the costs have to be paid by someone.

This follows with productive property as well. If a company is in use of a factory, it makes sense that the company would incorporate the costs of that factory into the costs of their products. This also creates an incentive: because property must be cared for by the occupant, it makes sense to only use what you need otherwise your product costs will be higher than they need to be.

## Governance

Companies are self-governing, and therefor are free to choose whatever structure they see fit. For instance, how is it decided to purchase or sell a resource from/to the capitalist market? What ecological methods are used to make sure farm land isn't permanently damaged? Are these decisions made via direct election or does the company elect a minister or council to handle these decisions?

Governance in the Basis system is generalized, and can be done via a number of voting or consensus mechanisms or can be done using a system of permissions that apply either to a member or a group of members (a council). Assigned permissions can be company-wide or only pertain to a specific class of resources. Decisions and permissions can be given by the members, and can be revoked by the members.
