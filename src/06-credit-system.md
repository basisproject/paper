# Chapter 6: Credit system

Workers, in exchange for their labor, receive credits. After a labor record has been finalized by the company, the credits for that labor are printed by the system and transferred into the worker's preferred wallet.

Credits can be spent on goods and services provided by companies in the Basis system, and are destroyed on spending. They can also be freely [converted to local currency](#cashing-out) for purchasing from the capitalist markets.

## Properties of credits

While it might be somewhat clear that credits share some DNA with labor vouchers, there are some significant differences.

Credits do not expire. There is no attempt made by the monetary system to limit individual accumulation of credits in any way.

Secondly, credits are freely transferable, privately and anonymously, to other members. This allows for secondary markets, which Basis has no desire to control or eliminate in any way. If your toaster breaks, why buy a new toaster when you can buy your neighbor's for half the price? It's not ecological to force everyone in the system to buy everything new. It's also futile to attempt to eliminate secondary markets completely. So we don't bother.

The case for non-transferable credits is that people might *sell their labor* in the secondary market and therefor the secondary market must be eliminated. If we have a situation where people feel compelled to sell their labor in the secondary market instead of the primary market, Basis is a failed system. What we need instead of control and force is strong incentives to participate in the primary economy. For instance, someone selling their labor in the secondary economy would need enough credits to buy the equipment they need *up-front* whereas if they are a producing member in the main economy, they would be given an up-front cost ceiling (ie, a social investment). Secondly, member companies cannot pay people in credits because they don't handle credits so if you're selling your labor in the secondary economy only those who are also operating in the secondary economy can hire you.

## Universal Basic Income (UBI)

This particular aspect of the currency system is extremely important. In effect, it acts as the pressure release valve for many aspects of the economy. Let's first define the properties of our UBI, and then we'll go over the possible effects.

- UBI is printed and paid out periodically such that each individual network member gets the same amount each time it's paid.
- Credits and UBI are not interchangeable. They are distinct currencies.
- UBI is paid into a special wallet that is attached to each member.
- The UBI wallet has a ceiling value which caps the maximum amount of value the UBI wallet can hold. For instance this ceiling value might be 3 or 6 months' worth of periodic value. This effectively limits UBI from accumulating endlessly if it's not spent.
- Unlike labor credits, UBI cannot be transferred to other members. It is always per-member.
- UBI can *only* be spent on in-network products and services (including housing costs), and *cannot* be converted to external currency.

### Effects and goals of UBI

We've defined a per-person currency that only accumulates to a certain amount and must be spent directly on products and services produced in the primary economy. If the UBI is high enough to be a living wage, what this does is effectively remove the cost of survival from the productive system. In effect, we make it easy to quit a job. This is seemingly banal but the effect is incredible: this would lower externalities in production, lower the labor costs of products significantly, and ultimately make the productive system much more adaptable.

If nobody needs a job to survive, then there's no systemic pressure to *win at all costs*, which effectively would eliminate entire classes of externalities. No longer do companies have to balance survival with being community members, because survival doesn't need to be covered by the productive system. Companies are free to expand and contract as members see fit without needing to worry about the welfare of those who might come and go. Industries that find themselves teetering on obsolescence (for instance the coal industry) could be phased out more easily and quickly if the participants in that industry no longer relied on their jobs to put food on the table. What were once bureaucracies can now be adhocracies. The productive system is free to morph and shift to the will of the participants without fear of leaving people behind, and without massive and expensive governments redistribution programs.

Now imagine everyone gets a living wage just for being a member. It's quite possible that people might not even feel compelled to take a wage for many jobs. This would mean the costs of products and services is no longer the cost of labor and resources, but just resources. In effect, profitless production in combination with a living wage UBI *could make communism a reality*.

There's one more important point to make. There are entire classes of people who do productive labor every day and are not compensated for it. This includes homemakers, stay at home parents, community service volunteers, artists, etc. Don't these people deserve compensation for their contribution to society?
