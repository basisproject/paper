# Chapter 6: Credit system

Workers, in exchange for their labor, receive credits. After a labor record has been finalized by the company, the credits for that labor are printed by the system and transferred into the worker's preferred wallet.

Credits can be spent on goods and services provided by companies in the Basis system, and are destroyed on spending. They can also be freely [converted to local currency][currency-conversion] for purchasing from the capitalist markets.

## Properties of credits

While it might be somewhat clear that credits share some DNA with labor vouchers, there are some significant differences.

Credits do not expire. There is no attempt made by the monetary system to limit individual accumulation of credits in any way.

Secondly, credits are freely transferable, privately and anonymously, to other members. This allows for secondary markets, which Basis has no desire to control or eliminate in any way. If your toaster breaks, why buy a new toaster when you can buy your neighbor's for half the price? It's not ecological to force everyone in the system to buy everything new. It's also futile to attempt to eliminate secondary markets completely. So we don't bother.

The case for non-transferable credits is that people might *sell their labor* in the secondary market and therefor the secondary market must be eliminated. If we have a situation where people feel compelled to sell their labor in the secondary market instead of the primary market, Basis is a failed system. What we need instead of control and force is strong incentives to participate in the primary economy. For instance, someone selling their labor in the secondary economy would need enough credits to buy the equipment they need *up-front* whereas if they are a producing member in the main economy, they would be given an up-front cost ceiling (ie, a social investment). Secondly, member companies cannot pay people directly in credits because they don't handle credits, so if you're selling your labor in the secondary economy only those who are also operating in the secondary economy can hire you.

## Universal Basic Income (UBI)

This particular aspect of the currency system is extremely important. In effect, it acts as the pressure release valve for the entire economy. Let's first define the properties of our UBI, and then we'll go over the possible effects.

- UBI is printed and paid out whenever participants wish to claim it, and is paid based on how much time has elapsed since it was last claimed.
- Credits and UBI are not interchangeable. They are distinct currencies.
- UBI is paid into a special wallet that is attached to each network member.
- The UBI wallet has a ceiling value which caps the maximum amount of value the UBI wallet can hold. For instance this ceiling value might be 12 months' worth of periodic value. This effectively limits UBI from accumulating endlessly if it's not spent.
- Unlike labor credits, UBI cannot be transferred to other members. It is always attached to one person.
- UBI can *only* be spent on in-network products and services (including housing costs), and *cannot* be converted to external currency.
- UBI can *only* be spent on non-currency costs of products and services. In other words, if an apple has a cost of `3â‚¡ + $2`, the UBI can pay for the apple's three credits, but the $2 of currency value will have to be covered by credits obtained through labor. The reason for this is that currency costs are an obligation to the market that must be paid back by value creation. If this obligation is not met, the network will go bankrupt and fail. This has another interesting side effect though: producers are incentivized to obtain their inputs to production in-network because it means their outputs will have less currency and consumers will be able to afford them at a higher rate. In other words, a systemic incentive on productive self-sufficiency.

### Effects and goals of UBI

We've defined a per-person currency that only accumulates to a certain amount and must be spent directly on products and services produced in the primary economy. If the UBI is high enough to be a living wage, what this does is effectively remove the cost of survival from the productive system. In effect, we make it easy to quit a job. This is seemingly banal but the effect is incredible: this would lower externalities in production, lower the labor costs of products significantly, and ultimately make the productive system much more adaptable.

If nobody needs a job to survive, then there's no systemic pressure to *win at all costs*, which would effectively not only eliminate entire classes of externalities but also reduce the pressure of competition within the system. No longer do companies have to balance survival with being community members, because survival doesn't need to be covered by the productive system. Companies are free to expand and contract as members see fit without needing to worry about the welfare of those who might come and go. Industries that find themselves teetering on obsolescence (for instance the coal industry) could be phased out more easily and quickly if the participants in that industry no longer relied on their jobs to put food on the table. What were once bureaucracies can now be [adhocracies][adhoc]. The productive system is free to morph and shift to the will of the participants without fear of leaving people behind, and without massive and expensive redistribution programs.

Now imagine everyone gets a living wage just for being a member. It's quite possible that people might not even feel compelled to take a wage for many jobs. This would mean the costs of products and services is no longer the cost of labor and resources, but just resources. In effect, profitless production in combination with a living wage UBI *could make self-organized communism a reality*.

There's one more important point to make. There are entire classes of people who do productive labor every day and are not compensated for it. This includes homemakers, stay at home parents, community service volunteers, artists, etc. Don't these people deserve compensation for their contributions to society regardless of how markets value their contributions?

### UBI Governance

[An automated "sufficiency" metric][sufficiency] which measures how self-sufficient the network is as a whole (in other words, how much of the participants' needs and wants are provided internally vs how much are provided by the outside market). In the beginning when sufficiency is lowest, the amount and ceiling of UBI will be set as constant values in the system. As the self-sufficiency metric increases, the UBI amount and ceiling will be more and more controlled by democratic process.

The democratic process is described in the [chapter on governance][governance], but in general will involve voting on how much UBI should be paid over time and what the UBI account ceiling balance should be.

The reason for this setup is that in the beginning, the network is fragile and paying out a living wage UBI would have the large potential to quickly drain the network of its value. A network-provided UBI is at its most effective when the network is self-sufficient because it means the value system of capitalist markets have been replaced, allowing us to create our own system of value.
