# Chapter 8: Education

One of the primary goals of regional socialism is to make it cheap and easy to learn a trade. Markets can shift, companies can fail, and giving people an option to find new work is essential. It's also essential to not punish them financially for doing so.

In places missing higher education that trains people to become productive members of society, regional socialism seeks to start schools and subsidize the education for the members of the region.
