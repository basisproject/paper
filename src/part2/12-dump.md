### Work

Agents work.

### Consumer purchases

Agents buy things.

#### Pricing

So far we've talked a lot about costs. Does this mean that every product purchased by a consumer will be provided at-cost? No, and there two facets to this.

First, for members, the system will *optimize for* providing products at-cost. In other words, companies that do sell products for exactly their cost will be rewarded (more on this in the [cybernetics section](#cybernetics)). That said, companies can set whatever prices above or below cost they want. The difference from a capitalist market however is that when a company sells a widget for 10₡ that only cost 8₡ to produce, it doesn't realize the extra 2₡: the credits are still burned on purchase.

Secondly, for non-members, companies are incentivized to sell at the highest price they can. So each product that is available for public consumption will have at least two prices: the in-network price and the market price.

So why let companies set arbitrary prices at all? It enables things like clearing inventory for products that didn't sell well, and also it enables inventory control for higher-value items. Member companies don't realize the delta between cost and price as a gain or loss, but rather it is used as a signal to determine if the production of that particular product should be expanded or contracted. In other words, we retain the *signal mechanism* from pricing *without using it as a distribution mechanism*.

This system of pricing is described in "Towards a New Socialism" [^2].


#### Cybernetics

Cybernetics is a system of self-regulating and automated control. We employ cybernetics to incentivize companies to act in the best interests of the network. This is done by adjusting a company's cost ceiling: the more the company acts in the interests of the network, the higher its cost ceiling. In effect, a high cost ceiling translates to a higher social investment.

#### Anonymity

While the transactions between member companies are transparent and freely observable by any member of the network, there are a few cases where privacy is offered:

- Consumer purchases. Whether a member or a non-member, purchasing goods from a member company is anonymous. The order is viewable by members, but looks like it came from the Basis system directly and is not tied back to the originator in any way. Only the user and the company have the full information on the order.
- Non-member orders. Any time a non-member is involved in an order, the order details will be available, but the non-member company will be anonymized. This is to protect the privacy of companies who do not wish for their purchasing to be transparent. Like consumer purchases, the order will look like it came from the Basis system directly, and the non-member company's identity will be anonymized.
