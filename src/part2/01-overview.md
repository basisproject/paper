# Part 2: Protocol definition

## Chapter 1: A high level view of Basis

Basis -- a protocol for post-capitalist production -- can be broken down at a high level into a few types of entities: agents, blocs, resources, and network. The protocol describes these entities, and the dynamics and interactions they have with each other.

The economics used in the Basis protocol are an extension of the ValueFlows [^1] protocol.

### Agents

Agents are individual people who are participating in the protocol. While they can be productive, they do not necessarily have to be. Agents are the initiating force behind any movement within the protocol: from performing labor to voting to consuming products, all actions within the protocol are driven by agents.

### Blocs

Blocs are *recursive* groupings of [agents](#chapter-2-agents), other blocs, and [resources](#chapter-4-resources). All productive activity, cost accounting, use of shared resources, and protocol-based group decision-making happens through blocs. A bloc can have just one single member, or can have millions of members that are both agents or other blocs. A bloc can be a productive entity, a geographic grouping of people and resources (a town, for instance), or any other grouping people wish to associate under.

### Resources

Resources are anything that can be used or consumed. This could be a chair, a tractor, a factory, a river, a beach condo complex...anything that might be used or consumed in a productive capacity or for normal use by individuals. Resources are what blocs exchange over the protocol's transactional fabric. They are consumed as inputs to production and produced as outputs of production.

### Network

The network as an entity encompasses all agents, blocs, and resources. It also holds a set of global information and parameters that are managed democratically by all agents. This includes things like how much UBI each agent gets, which resources are cost-tracked, and the occupation database.

### Entity interactions

The interactions between the four entity types we've defined form the foundations of the protocol, and each of them will have a dedicated chapter.
