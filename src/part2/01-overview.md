# Part 2: Protocol definition

## Chapter 1: A high level view of Basis

Basis -- a protocol for post-capitalist production -- can be broken down at a high level into three main components: agents, resources, and blocs. All other actions or parts of the protocol are in support of the interactions between these three components.

An **agent** represents a single person participating in the protocol. Agents are the initiating force behind any movement within the protocol: from performing labor to voting to consuming products. All actions within the protocol are driven by agents.

**Resources** are anything that can be used or consumed. This could be a chair, a tractor, a factory, a river, a beach condo complex...anything that might be used or consumed in a productive capacity or for normal use by individuals.

**Blocs** are groupings of [agents](#chapter-2-agents) and [resources](#chapter-4-resources). All productive activity, cost accounting, use of shared resources, and protocol-based group decision-making happens through blocs. A bloc can have just one single member, or can have millions of members. A bloc can be a productive entity, a geographic grouping of people and resources (a town, for instance), or any other grouping people wish to associate under.

### Economics

In Basis, blocs track costs directly, and assign these costs to their products and services. Costs are separate groupings of *labor* and *tracked resources*. Blocs then assign these costs to their products. When another bloc orders these products, the cost is transferred from the producing bloc to the ordering bloc. No exchange of currency happens. When an agent consumes a product, the costs of that product are removed from the system. This direct cost tracking avoids the need for currency within the productive system and eliminates the idea of profit.

The economics used in the Basis protocol are an extension of the ValueFlows [^1] protocol, a Resource-Event-Agent (REA) accounting system that allows defining flows of resources through productive networks.
