# Part 2: Protocol definition

## Chapter 1: A high level view of Basis

Basis -- a protocol for post-capitalist production -- can be broken down at a high level into three main components: agents, resources, and blocs. All other actions or parts of the protocol are in support of the interactions between these three components.

An **agent** represents a single person participating in the protocol. Agents are the initiating force behind any movement within the protocol: from performing labor to voting to consuming products. All actions within the protocol are driven by agents.

**Resources** are anything that can be used or consumed. This could be a chair, a tractor, a factory, a river, a beach condo complex...anything that might be used or consumed in a productive capacity or for normal use by individuals.

**Blocs** are groupings of [agents] and [resources]. All productive activity, cost accounting, use of shared resources, and protocol-based group decision-making happens through blocs. A bloc can have just one single member, or can have millions of members. A bloc can be a productive entity, a geographic grouping of people and resources (a town, for instance), or any other grouping people wish to associate under.

It's important to note that this part of the paper assumes the Basis protocol is ubiquitous. It focuses solely on the dynamics of the protocol itself. Part 3 of the paper will outline methods of interacting with systems outside of the protocol and detail how value translations are made.

### Economics

As most of this protocol revolves around economics, it's important to outline some of the ultimate goals of the economic relations in Basis.

Production is engaged in without profit or exchange of currency. Blocs track costs directly, and assign these costs to their products and services. Costs are separate groupings of *labor* and [tracked resources][trackers]. Blocs then assign these costs to their products, and they are only able to assign costs already assumed by the bloc: inputs and outputs must match. When another bloc orders one of these products, the product's cost is transferred from the producing bloc to the ordering bloc. No exchange of currency happens. When an agent consumes a product, the costs of that product are removed from the system. This direct cost tracking avoids the need for currency within the productive system and eliminates the idea of profit.

When a bloc marks a product as available for agent consumption, it is given a price. This price can be set *independently* of the *cost* of the product (for instance if demand drops, the bloc can set a clearing price). However, the bloc does not realize any difference between the *cost* and the *price* because the currency used by the consuming agent is destroyed on spend.

In the absence of profit and a strong link between *price* and *cost*, another mechanism must act as the feedback mechanism for blocs. Basis uses a [cybernetics system][cybernetics] that adjusts a bloc's "cost allowance" (how much costs it can assume in total at any given point) based on its overall, ongoing performance.

As a final note, the economic vocabulary used in the Basis protocol are an extension of the ValueFlows [^vf] protocol, a Resource-Event-Agent (REA) accounting system that allows defining flows of resources through productive networks. Many of the processes or actions described in the Basis protocol will reference various portions of ValueFlows.
