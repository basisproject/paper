## Chapter 1: A high level view of Basis

Basis -- a protocol for post-capitalist production -- can be broken down at a high level into three major types of entities: members, blocs, and resources. The protocol describes these entities, and the dynamics and interactions they have with each other.

### Members

Members are individual people who are participating in the protocol. While they can be productive, they do not necessarily have to be. Members are the initiating force behind any movement within the protocol: from performing labor to voting to consuming products, all actions within the protocol are driven by members.

### Blocs

Blocs are *recursive* groupings of [members](#chapter-2-members), other blocs, and [resources](#chapter-4-resources). All productive activity, cost accounting, use of shared resources, and protocol-based group decision-making happens through blocs. A bloc can have just one single member, or can have millions of members that are both individuals or other blocs. A bloc can be a productive entity, or a geographic grouping of people and resources (a town, for instance).

### Resources

Resources are anything that can be used or consumed. This could be a chair, a tractor, a factory, a river, a beach condo complex...anything that might be used or consumed in a productive capacity or for normal use by individuals. Resources are what blocs exchange over the protocol's transactional fabric. They are consumed as inputs to production and produced as outputs of protuction.
