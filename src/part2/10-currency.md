## Chapter 10: Currency, credits, and UBI

Every agent has the ability to accrue the network currency (credits, â‚¡) in any number of accounts they wish to manage. Credits can be spent on goods and services provided by companies in the Basis system. Credits differ from money in that they are *destroyed when spent*. Credits do not circulate the primary economy, and only exist within the accounts of agents.

### Labor credits

Labor credits are created by performing work within a productive bloc and are transferred to the agent once that work has been validated by the bloc. This creation and transfer has two effects: the value of the credits is added to one of the agent's accounts, and the labor cost of that amount is added to the bloc's [set of costs][costs].

While it might be somewhat clear that credits share some DNA with labor vouchers, there are some significant differences.

Credits do not expire. There is no attempt made by the monetary system to limit individual accumulation of credits in any way.

Secondly, credits are freely transferable, privately and anonymously, to other members. This allows for secondary markets, which Basis has no desire to control or eliminate in any way. If your toaster breaks, why buy a new toaster when you can buy your neighbor's for half the price? It's not ecological to force everyone in the system to buy everything new. It's also futile to attempt to eliminate secondary markets completely. So we don't bother.

The case for non-transferable credits is that people might *sell their labor* in the secondary market and therefor the secondary market must be eliminated. If we have a situation where people feel compelled to sell their labor in the secondary market instead of the primary market, Basis is a failed system. What we need instead of control and force is strong incentives to participate in the primary economy. For instance, someone selling their labor in the secondary economy would need enough credits to buy the equipment they need *up-front* whereas if they are a producing member in the main economy, they might be given an up-front cost allowance (ie, a social investment). Secondly, member companies cannot pay people directly in credits because they don't handle credits, so if you're selling your labor in the secondary economy only those who are also operating in the secondary economy can hire you.

### UBI Credits (Universal Basic Income)

UBI credits are earned simply by being an agent in the Basis protocol and accrue on a regular schedule. UBI credits act differently to labor credits in a few ways:

- UBI credits are printed and paid out whenever participants wish to claim them, and are paid based on how much time has elapsed since they were last claimed.
- Labor credits and UBI credits are not interchangeable. They are distinct currencies.
- UBI credits are paid into a special account that is attached to each agent.
- The UBI account has a ceiling value which caps the maximum amount of credits the account can hold. For instance this ceiling value might be 12 months' worth of periodic value. This effectively limits UBI from accumulating endlessly if it's not spent.
- Unlike labor credits, UBI credits cannot be transferred to other members. It is always attached to one person.

#### Anonymity

While the transactions between member companies are transparent and freely observable by any member of the network, there are a few cases where privacy is offered:

Consumer purchases. Whether a member or a non-member, purchasing goods from a member bloc is anonymous. The order is viewable by members, but looks like it came from the Basis system directly and is not tied back to the originator in any way. Only the user and the bloc have the full information on the order.
