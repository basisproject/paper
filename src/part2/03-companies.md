## Chapter 3: Companies

All companies are controlled by their members. Leadership (if any) must be selected by individual members, and all policies regarding membership of companies must be ratified by individual members. As such, Basis defines a company as a bottom-up power structure that puts individuals in control of the things that affect them the most.

Companies and members are freely-associating entities: any member or company can join any company as long as they meet the membership requirements.
