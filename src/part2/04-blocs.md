## Chapter 4: Blocs

A bloc is a grouping of [agents] and [resources]. The agents that are part of a bloc are known as "members" and the relationship between a bloc and a resource is known as [stewardship].

All blocs are cooperative entities controlled by their members. Leadership (if any) must ultimately be selected by individual agents, and all policies regarding membership of blocs must be ratified by the members. As such, Basis defines a bloc as a bottom-up power structure that puts individual agents in ultimate control of the groups they are members of.

Blocs and agents are freely-associating entities: any agent can join any bloc as long as the entities involved consent to the association.

Blocs are free to use whatever organization structure they see fit. There is not any predetermined pattern or framework blocs must follow, with the caveat that the members in a bloc have ultimate power regrading the bloc. Blocs can use a traditional top-down structure where members select a board/council that determines overall direction and leadership, or blocs can be run as a collective where everyone is involved in making every decision. Blocs can have vesting schedules for new members. They can be set up as multi-stakeholder entities (for instance, shared control between workers, customers, vendors, and/or the public).

Membership in a bloc is completely decided by the bloc itself. Membership might be determined by geographical location, interest or skill in a particular sector of production, and can even depend on things like compulsory ordering of a service every month (which could be structured as a membership fee or even a tax in the case of a municipal bloc). Some blocs might require membership in sister blocs: perhaps you cannot be a member of the Duluth Housing bloc if you are not also a member of the Duluth Municipal bloc.

### Bloc cost allowance

Every bloc has a cost allowance. This is a variable number that determines the upper limit on costs that the bloc can assume. If the bloc's total costs (the sum of all the bloc's resources and processes) reaches this number, the protocol prevents the bloc from taking on any new costs, be it ordering inventory, paying wages, or any other ways that blocs can take on new costs. The cost allowance can be thought of as the total amount of societal debt that a bloc may take on.

The total costs of a bloc can be determined by taking the costs of all the bloc's resources and all the bloc's processes and [summing them together][cost-addition]. This gives a final cost object, which can be [converted into a final number][cost-conversion].

Once a bloc's total costs reaches its cost allowance, a bloc must find a way to unload its costs. This would happen via other blocs [ordering products][orders] or through direct member taxation.

The actual cost allowance value is determined by the [investment] and [cybernetics] systems defined by the protocol.
