## Chapter 2: Agents

An agent is any individual who wishes to be a part of the Basis protocol. The particulars of how somebody becomes an agent is left to [Part 3](#part-3-the-real-world). For our purposes here, we will assume that somebody is an agent for no other reason than they wish to be one, and leave it at that.

All agents are equal within the Basis protocol. They all have the same abilities and privileges. This includes equal abilities to freely associate with other agents, equal decision-making power in the blocs they are associated with, and equal access to and management of the resources around them.

Every action within the protocol, whether direct or indirect, is driven by an agent acting as an agent of the protocol. While this is probably true of most protocols, it's worth stating.

One last important aspect of agentship: all agents own all protocol-defined resources *equally*. An agent in India is an equal owner of the factory in Canada, and an agent in Hawaii is an equal owner of widget batch #506771 produced by Widgets"R"Us in Africa. While the *use* of these resources is defined to a large extent by the protocol and the agents themselves, all ownership of all resources tracked by the Basis protocol are equally owned by all agents. We will talk more about resources, stewardship, and use in the [resources chapter](#chapter-4-resources).

### Agents and identity

Basis requires the use of an identity protocol for agentship. This ensures various aspects of the protocol are the same for everyone. For instance, without *identity* the protocol would not be able to determine if someone cast multiple votes in a decision.

### Credit system

Every agent has the ability to accrue the network currency (credits, â‚¡) in any number of accounts they wish to manage. Credits can be spent on goods and services provided by companies in the Basis system. Credits differ from money in that they are *destroyed when spent*. Credits do not circulate the primary economy, and only exist within the accounts of agents.

There are two separate classes of credits: labor credits and UBI credits.

#### Labor credits

Labor credits are created by [performing work][working] within a productive bloc and are transferred to the agent once that work has been validated by the bloc. This creation and transfer has two effects: the value of the credits is added to one of the agent's accounts, and the labor cost of that amount is added to the bloc's [set of costs][costs].

While it might be somewhat clear that credits share some DNA with labor vouchers, there are some significant differences.

Credits do not expire. There is no attempt made by the monetary system to limit individual accumulation of credits in any way.

Secondly, credits are freely transferable, privately and anonymously, to other members. This allows for secondary markets, which Basis has no desire to control or eliminate in any way. If your toaster breaks, why buy a new toaster when you can buy your neighbor's for half the price? It's not ecological to force everyone in the system to buy everything new. It's also futile to attempt to eliminate secondary markets completely. So we don't bother.

The case for non-transferable credits is that people might *sell their labor* in the secondary market and therefor the secondary market must be eliminated. If we have a situation where people feel compelled to sell their labor in the secondary market instead of the primary market, Basis is a failed system. What we need instead of control and force is strong incentives to participate in the primary economy. For instance, someone selling their labor in the secondary economy would need enough credits to buy the equipment they need *up-front* whereas if they are a producing member in the main economy, they might be given an up-front cost allowance (ie, a social investment). Secondly, member companies cannot pay people directly in credits because they don't handle credits, so if you're selling your labor in the secondary economy only those who are also operating in the secondary economy can hire you.

#### UBI Credits (Universal Basic Income)

UBI credits are earned simply by being an agent in the Basis protocol and accrue on a regular schedule. UBI credits act differently to labor credits in a few ways:

- UBI credits are printed and paid out whenever participants wish to claim them, and are paid based on how much time has elapsed since they were last claimed.
- Labor credits and UBI credits are not interchangeable. They are distinct currencies.
- UBI credits are paid into a special account that is attached to each network member.
- The UBI account has a ceiling value which caps the maximum amount of credits the account can hold. For instance this ceiling value might be 12 months' worth of periodic value. This effectively limits UBI from accumulating endlessly if it's not spent.
- Unlike labor credits, UBI credits cannot be transferred to other members. It is always attached to one person.
- UBI credits can *only* be spent on costs that were created in-network.

##### Effects and goals of UBI

Defining a currency that everyone gets regularly that cannot be transferred and can only be spent on internally-produced products and services has some great benefits for both participants and the network as a whole. If the UBI is high enough to be a living wage, what this does is effectively remove the cost of survival from the productive system. In effect, we make it easy to quit a job. This is seemingly banal but the effect is incredible: this would lower externalities in production, lower the labor costs of products significantly, and ultimately make the productive system much more adaptable.

If nobody needs a job to survive, then there's no systemic pressure to *win at all costs*, which would effectively not only eliminate entire classes of externalities but also reduce the pressure of competition within the system. No longer do companies have to balance survival with being community members, because survival doesn't need to be covered by the productive system. Companies are free to expand and contract as members see fit without needing to worry about the welfare of those who might come and go. Industries that find themselves teetering on obsolescence (for instance the thermal coal industry) could be phased out more easily and quickly if the participants in that industry no longer relied on their jobs to put food on the table. What were once bureaucracies can now be [adhocracies][adhoc]. The productive system is free to morph and shift to the will of the participants without fear of leaving people behind, and without massive and expensive redistribution programs.

If everyone gets a living wage just for being a participant, it's quite possible that people might not even feel compelled to take a wage for many jobs. This would mean the costs of products and services is no longer the cost of labor and resources, but just resources. In effect, profitless production in combination with a living wage UBI *could make self-organized, resource-based communism a reality*.

There's one more important point to make. There are entire classes of people who do productive labor every day and are not compensated for it. This includes homemakers, stay at home parents, community service volunteers, artists, etc. Don't these people deserve compensation for their contributions to society regardless of how markets value their contributions?
