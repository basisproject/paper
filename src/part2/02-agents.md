## Chapter 2: Agents

An agent is any individual who wishes to be a part of the Basis protocol. The particulars of how somebody becomes an agent is left to [Part 3](#part-3-the-real-world). For our purposes here, we will assume that somebody is an agent for no other reason than they wish to be one, and leave it at that.

All agents are equal within the Basis protocol. They all have the same abilities and privileges. This includes equal abilities to freely associate with other agents, equal decision-making power in the blocs they are associated with, and equal access to and management of the resources around them.

Every action within the protocol, whether direct or indirect, is driven by an agent acting as an agent of the protocol. While this is probably true of most protocols, it's worth stating.

One last important aspect of agentship: all agents own all protocol-defined resources *equally*. An agent in India is an equal owner of the factory in Canada, and an agent in Hawaii is an equal owner of widget batch #506771 produced by Widgets"R"Us in Africa. While the *use* of these resources is defined to a large extent by the protocol and the agents themselves, all ownership of all resources tracked by the Basis protocol are equally owned by all agents. We will talk more about resources, stewardship, and use in the [resources chapter](#chapter-4-resources).

### Agents and identity

Basis requires the use of an identity protocol for agentship. This ensures various aspects of the protocol are the same for everyone. For instance, without *identity* the protocol would not be able to determine if someone cast multiple votes in a decision.
