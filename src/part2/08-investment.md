#### Product pricing

So far we've talked a lot about costs. Does this mean that every product purchased by a consumer will be provided at-cost? No, and there two facets to this.

First, for agents, the system will *optimize for* providing products at-cost. In other words, companies that do sell products for exactly their cost will be rewarded. That said, companies can set whatever prices above or below cost they want. The difference from a moneyed market however is that when a bloc sells a widget for 10₡ that only cost 8₡ to produce, it doesn't realize the extra 2₡: the credits are still burned on purchase.

So why let companies set arbitrary prices at all? It enables things like clearing inventory for products that didn't sell well, and also it enables inventory control for higher-value items. Member companies don't realize the delta between cost and price as a gain or loss, but rather it is used as a signal to determine if the production of that particular product should be expanded or contracted. In other words, we retain the *signal mechanism* from pricing *without using it as a distribution mechanism*.

This system of pricing is described in "Towards a New Socialism" [^tns]
