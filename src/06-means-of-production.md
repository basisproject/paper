# Chapter 6: Means of Production

Social ownership of the means of production is one of the main staples of socialism. For our purposes, means of production will refer mainly to fixed capital, and social ownership will refer to a regionally-owned company that manages the region's fixed capital. Fixed capital is defined as land, buildings such as offices, warehouses, and factories, and in some cases large machinery used in the productive process. While things like laptops, phones, desks, etc are used in the productive process, the region seeks no relationship with these items and concerns itself only with larger assets.

It's important to note that the social ownership of the means of production is not a goal just to satisfy the definition of socialism, but instead to make the operation of the companies operating within the region *more competitive with the outside market system*. If companies can rent an office, factory, warehouse, or machinery *at-cost* then they have an edge over companies outside the region who are having profit extracted via rent.

The assets of the means of production will be managed by a regionally-owned company (the MoP agency), with a board of directors with the following stipulations:

- At least two directors must have experience in commercial property management.
- At least one director must have a legal background in property management.
- At least one director must be a non-leadership employee of the company.

This board will be responsible for deciding what types of assets to purchase or sell and for choosing the leadership for the company.

## Asset purchasing

The MoP agency will be responsible for purchasing the means of production for the region. Exactly what should be purchased will happen in a few different ways. For offices, the MoP agency will keep a wait-list of businesses looking to rent office space. This wait-list will also show what kind of office space companies need (whether they need an entire office floor, one small office, or just a desk somewhere). If the demand is higher than the supply by some threshold, the MoP agency will need to buy more office space. It does this by borrowing money from the regional bank.

It's also possible the MoP agency will want to buy land and construct new office buildings on it, which would also be funded by the regional bank.

## Asset selling

If supply of productive assets outnumbers regional demand by some threshold, it might make sense to rent some assets out at *market rate* to non-regional companies (regional members remaining in the space would still have preferred rates).

If a productive asset has gained enough value in the market, for instance in the case of an office building, it might make financial sense to sell it and move the regional occupants to other office space in the region.

The ultimate goal of this system is not to make profit, but if the opportunity presents itself without putting much burden on regional members or companies, then that capital could be used to buy housing or invest in more companies.

## Pricing

The means of production will be rented out at-cost. However, different assets will have different pricing requirements. For instance the cost of a warehouse used by one company might be significantly more than the cost of a small three-person office space.

Because of these differences, the cost of each office space, warehouse, factory, etc will be per-unit. In other words, if the MoP agency has to get a mortgage to buy an office unit, the pricing of the offices in that unit would need to incorporate the cost of that specific mortgage. When the mortgage is paid off, the regional tenants in that office building would see a significant reduction in rent. This is contrasted with housing, in which all costs are socialized and adjusted by the luxury score of each unit.

The monthly cost for any productive asset is defined as:

```
(unit_projected_10_year_average_cost / 120) + mop_agency_fee
```

Where `unit_projected_10_year_average_cost` will incorporate the mortgage, projected maintenance, and any other costs associated with the unit. `mop_agency_fee` will be set such that when paid by all businesses renting productive assets equally, it will cover the costs of operation. This fee will likely be set such that a surplus is generated for the first few years and can be gradually adjusted downward once the MoP agency has enough reserves to cover unforeseen expenses.

While it might seem unfair that some productive assets cost more than others, this is a necessary requirement to handle the diversity of the needs businesses will have. Over time, as mortgages are paid off, the prices will trend downward.
