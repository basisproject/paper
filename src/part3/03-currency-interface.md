## Chapter 3: Currency interfacing

#### Currency tracking

When a company needs to buy something from capitalist markets, it spends currency out of a [capital pool](#capital-pools) to do so. The cost of this currency, like all other costs, is tracked by Basis. This is covered in more detail in [the banking section](#currency-tracking-1).

### UBI

UBI can *only* be spent on non-currency costs of products and services. In other words, if an apple has a cost of `3â‚¡ + $2`, the UBI can pay for the apple's three credits, but the $2 of currency value will have to be covered by credits obtained through labor. The reason for this is that currency costs are an obligation to the market that must be paid back by value creation. If this obligation is not met, the network will go bankrupt and fail. This has another interesting side effect though: producers are incentivized to obtain their inputs to production in-network because it means their outputs will have less currency and consumers will be able to afford them at a higher rate. In other words, a systemic incentive on productive self-sufficiency.
