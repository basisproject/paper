# Chapter 1: Defining the problem

The problems with capitalism are generally fairly self-evident. There is the owning class, and the working class, and a somewhat fuzzy barrier separating the two. The government acts as the protector of the owning class, giving the working classes some protections (as much are needed to create a balanced system). The government is essentially, at least in the United States, a "captured agency." In essence, we do have a democracy...with the largest holders of capital getting the votes. Politicians are bought and legislation favorable to the already-immense corporations is passed. Propaganda of freedom and choice reigns supreme.

The freedom people think of when they look up, teary-eyed, at the American flag is nothing more than an illusion. Our political freedom, democracy, changes little. And as power centralizes in the federal government, people have even less control than ever while corporate powers gain more. But political freedom isn't everything. America has economic freedom as well! You can sell your labor to whoever wants your services. Hopefully your skills are in demand. If not, you can start a business! And for that, all you need is capital. You can get it by borrowing from a bank who will extract profit via interest long before *you're* profitable (and banks often want you to have capital already as collateral), or you can seek investment from venture capital by selling a (large) piece of your company. Breaking this down, in order to access capital, you need to enlist the support of a holder of capital, and they will be incentivized to take as much from you as possible. Economic freedom, in this case, means the freedom to beg for money from somebody who has it already. Often, it also means you must already have capital as well.

## Profit

One of the problems with how things work in market systems is that profit is the ultimate incentive. The problem is, profit does not care about the well being of the people generating it. It does not care about the environment. It does not care for stability or equilibrium. It cares only to install in the minds of the people engaging with it the unquenchable desire to generate ever more.

Profit is antagonistic to the goals of humanity. It drives production forward but does so in such a way that legal systems are required to temper its effects. And these legal systems always seem to be a step behind. And they always seem to be under attack by flag-waving patriots who love "freedom."

Profit isn't categorically bad, though. In a market system, it acts as a feedback mechanism. It allows people producing things to know whether to produce more or less of what they make. So what happens when profit can be made, can be reinvested in production to make things more efficient or to hire more workers, but cannot be distributed to those making it?

Profit, if separated from the individual, can act as an economic feedback mechanism without corrupting the ones interacting with it. It can allow participation in a market system, and interfacing with it, while those producing it are shielded from its negative effects.

### A note on markets

Why have a market system at all? The true value of markets is not their supposed efficiency or their aspects of self-organization. Instead, markets provide something much more valuable than efficiency, productivity, low prices, etc: *decentralization*.

Much of our problems come from concentration of power, and the wielding of that power over individuals. Once power is concentrated, even if it does not immediately corrupt, it becomes an obvious target for those who are corrupt.

The same can be said economically. Arguments for centralized planning as an operating model for an economy can be attractive. Often, the models of modern-day mega-corporations are used as examples of successful economic planning. And it's true, it can absolutely be done. The problem isn't the feasibility, it's the structure.

How many of those mega-corporations are managed democratically by the workers? What is the wage disparity between upper management and the rank and file workers? Corporations are managed as top-down oligarchies. And it's no surprise that this is exactly how other command economies are/were structured in the past. Is it conceivable to plan an economy, entirely, using a democratic forces? Yes. But setting up the checks and balances needed to do this in a way that protects against corruption would be...difficult.

Markets are not about efficiency. We've seem them to be irrational and inefficient. They are about extreme decentralization of economic power.

## Rent-seeking

Another big problem with a capitalist system is rent. Office buildings, apartments, factories, production equipment...these things are all privately-owned. The people owning them rent them out to others, but they do so at a profit. Essentially, someone with capital buys something, rents it out to others, and sits back while the money rolls in. Sure, they have to deal with maintenance and upkeep, and the amount of effort involved in this can be significant, but once their loans are paid off they are free to extract significant profit by paying others to do the upkeep while still charging market rate for the property. Essentially, anybody with capital can extract rent from people who do not have capital.

Why is it celebrated to have a class of people who make money simply by owning things? What are these people producing? What value are they adding to society?

What if, instead of extracting profit, these properties were community-owned, and rented out to individuals and companies at-cost, such that averaged over the year, the income and the expenses were equal? Now imagine these community-owned properties had all their loans paid off. Oh, how cheap it would be to rent an apartment or an office space if all you were paying for was the regular maintenance instead of lining the pockets of a mortgage bank or a private owner!

If you were to provide office spaces, factories, warehouses, and equipment to companies at-cost, instead of generating enough profit to pay those extracting profit from them, they can instead focus on their productive process and their work conditions. And because they're not making someone else richer in the process of their operation, they can run their business *while still being competitive against those who are having profit extracted from them via rent.* In essence, you lower the barriers to entry for business and allow the business to only pay, truly, for what it uses.

And if the workers of those companies could live in apartments or houses rented to them at-cost, then more of their wages could be spent on things that make them happy, such as art or travel. Or, perhaps, they could work four days a week instead of five. What a world!

Elimination of the rent-seeking class allows *much higher margins* both for companies and for individual workers. Beyond this, it creates stability and security. They know that their rent will only go up if the actual underlying costs go up, instead of rent going up because the private owner has their eye on a new Mercedes.

## Ownership

Ownership in capitalism is a fairly easy concept. Whoever holds the deed to a property owns it and this ownership is enforced by state agencies. Most companies are privately-owned as well, either with a small group of member-owners or a set of shareholders whose decision-making power is proportional to their share in ownership.

This model is antagonistic, however. Like people who buy property and rent it out for a profit, the owners of a company essentially extract profit from their employees. There is a class of owners, and a class of workers. The workers are told that this is fair because they have job security. Yet, we all know just how secure employment is when a company hits hard times.

So what's the alternative? Worker co-ops are the alternative.

Many people's initial reaction to worker-owned companies is "that doesn't work!" Collective decision making *is* difficult, and slow, and complicated. But just because workers own their own company doesn't mean they have to democratically make every single decision. In fact, a worker co-op can be structured *exactly* like a privately-owned company: a board of directors who hires the top-level management, and all decisions are made top-down from there (a hierarchical management structure seen in most large corporations). The difference is that the workers elect the board members.

Worker co-ops are generally as successful as privately-owned firms, but tend to focus less on seeking profit and more on working conditions and effects of operations on communities.

They do not solve every problem, but they help eliminate the concept of treating a business like a machine that exists only to profit the owners.

## Education

So many in the United States are pushed into higher education after finishing high school. This would be terrific, if not for the crippling debt the federal government holds over them, essentially turning them into indentured servants. Because student loans are not forgivable by bankruptcy, lenders are not incentivized to guide students into occupations that will end up paying the loan back. Because student loans are so easy to get, universities and colleges are essentially given a blank check of expansion (in both facilities and salaries), essentially fundraising their growth on the backs of the people they are supposedly helping into the working world. So, the federal government extracts profit from student loan interest, the lenders extract profit as well, the schools raise tuition astronomically *because they can*, and often the students get out of college and there are no job prospects because nobody told them they were training in a subject that was not economically viable.

Needless to say, education is an important part of a functioning economy. Imagine if schools were run with full transparency of spending, the teachers were paid as much as (or more than) the administrators, and classes and curriculum were crafted to fulfill the needs of the local economies. Imagine if students were encouraged to learn in order to find purpose instead of to make money for someone else.

## Solutions

We will define the solutions to these problems, and do so in a way compatible with the economic and legal system already existing in the United States (and possibly other countries).

The goal is to create a socialist system with voluntary membership, existing within capitalism, that tends slowly toward economic domination. It will be fueled by those who are freed from the most parasitic aspects of capitalism and handed the reigns to their own productive forces.

*The productive capacity of those who do what they do because they love doing it will always win against those who do what they do because they will starve if they do not.*
