In the following, the blueprint for a socialist society will be outlined, in detail, that satisfies the following requirements:

- Partial economic planning happens on the regional level, via democratic process
- Planning is used to adjust high-level allocations of societal investment, not to micromanage the economy
- Regions are federated and able to collaborate with each other
- The means of production is community owned (and thereby worker-owned) and managed transparently
- Companies are worker-owned and operate in a market system
- Company profits are treated specially, tempering some of the negative effects of markets
- Wages are decided regionally using a number of factors such as stress, danger, need, etc and are paid out to workers hourly
- Housing, edcuation, and other essential services are provided at-cost or subsidized
- Banking, and therefor investment, is decided using a democratically-decided plan which allows greater participation in deciding the direction of the local economy

The goals of this system are as follows:

- It can interface with and expand within a capitalist/market system.
- Its parameters are carefully tuned to maximize happiness, productivity, and growth.
- It operates regionally (within a city or county) and will split if it becomes too large, resisting centralization.
- It makes community investment transparent and encourages high-level conscientious decision making.
- It seeks to eliminate economic rent seeking for both individuals and for companies with the end result of making it much cheaper to start or join a participating company (and thereby promoting growth of the ecosystem).
- It grows via limited taxation, and therefor seeks to only provide costly services *to supplement missing options*, not to replace existing ones. In other words, why build and run K-12 schools if they already exist? Avoiding double-taxation is key to incentivize membership growth.
