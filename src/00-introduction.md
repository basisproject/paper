In the following, the blueprint for a socialist society will be outlined, in detail, that satisfies the following requirements:

- Partial economic planning happens on the regional level, via democratic process
- Planning is used to adjust high-level operations, not to micromanage the economy
- Regions are federated and able to collaborate with each other
- The means of production is community-owned (and thereby worker-owned)
- Wealth is automatically distributed based on hours worked and the difficulty of the work
- Personal property, such as owning a house or a car, is celebrated
- Human nature is accepted, not mutated into an unrealizable fantasy

This guide will be focused specifically on economic structure, carefully avoiding the topic of general governance. This is an economic guide, not an economic system horribly entangled into an opinionated political system (let's build one thing at a time). The ultimate goal is to see this vision realized within the confines of existing political and economic structures, not to languish as some utopian ideal.

Also, a best effort will be made to not reiterate -- for the trillionth time -- the inadequacies of capitalism (although there may be the occasional jab).
