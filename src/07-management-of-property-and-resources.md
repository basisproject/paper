# Chapter 7: Management of property and resources

In Basis, there are three main concepts regarding property and resources: ownership, stewardship, and use. Ownership is somewhat static: everyone who is a member of the network owns an equal share of all resources managed by the network. This includes property and natural resources, but really applies to anything tracked by the economic fabric. It's important to note that while ownership is shared, that doesn't mean anyone can do anything, but rather everyone has an equal ability to manage the resources that affect them.

Stewardship, held by companies, defines a relationship where a group of people get to decide on how a resource will be used. Keep in mind, a company isn't necessarily a *productive* company but can also be a town, neighborhood, or any collection of people with common purpose. Stewardship might mean setting guidelines on how a resource is used, setting time limits on use, determining costs of use, and any other facet that might arise.

Lastly, the concept of use is a relationship in which a resource is in active consumption by either a member or another company. Usage of a resource might often happen by members of the company in stewardship, but this isn't a given, and anyone can use a resource within the bounds set by the stewards. Even non-members can use a resource. For instance, an apartment could be rented to someone outside of the network for an at-profit rate, the difference between rent of the unit and cost of the unit being distributed back into the network (perhaps to aid in purchasing more apartments). There are no systemic rules on resource usage, only those set by the stewards.

## Simplicity and complexity of resource management

The system we use for property and resource usage is somewhat simple: groups of people manage resources. Who manages which resources is a difficult and interesting question, the answer to which is somewhat outside the bounds of this system. In reality, trying to devise a framework which can determine optimal placement of resources within groups of people is futile. The people themselves know which resources they should manage and which they shouldn't, and Basis makes no effort to enact any one system on them. In other words, the members are ultimately free to decide who stewards what properties and resources.

This is done through the [company governance process](#governance-1). Nations, regions, syndicates, and any other type of group works together to determine the optimal stewardship. It might just so happen that organization follows existing city, county, and state lines. Perhaps it will be entirely different. Members are free to organize as they see fit.

## Determining use

Determining *who* gets to use a resource could be as simple as first-come-first-serve. It could be a complicated decision tree based on information that may exist either inside or outside of the network.

For instance, perhaps a community only lets people have a second home if everyone in the community already has a primary residence. To do something like this, the community's housing company would need to know the usage status of every member, not just in that company, but in other companies.

A regional farming company might give usage of farm land to members under the condition that they follow certain guidelines on land maintenance. They might provide tractors for farming companies with time limits on use.

There are many ways in which use can manifest. Basis strives to provide a system of automating determination of use as a way of reducing administration and increasing member trust. Ultimately though, use can be assigned using any agreement between steward and user, whether automated or by hand. Because companies are controlled by their members, people are free to find the best ways of organizing.

## Fail-safe

There are interesting considerations to the above system of property and resource management. If a housing company has a mass exodus and a handful of jerks find themselves in stewardship of an entire neighborhood which they wish to keep others out of, how is this problem solved? Self-organization works wonderfully if people can form consensus, but if there are conflicts, what then?

Basis has a fail-safe mechanism: people within a certain geographical distance of a resource can band together and change the steward of that resource with a vote. This is a measure that only needs to be used in extreme cases, but will ultimately put the control of a resource into the hands of the people closest to it. Keep in mind, this power only determines stewardship. All other aspects of the resource (including rules on use) can only be changed by the steward.

This in itself is not a perfect system. What would be closer to perfect is if the people *affected* by a resource were the ones to decide how it is managed, and the weight of their deciding power would be determined by how much that resource affects them. However, determining the amount that someone is affected by something is an impossibly complicated and subjective problem to solve. There are ways to sidestep this complexity and let people communicate this *affect*, but this itself comes with its own set of issues. Until a better method presents itself, the most effective way to move forward is simply geographical connection. This mirrors a favorable aspect of our current system: local production and decision making. The people of a region know their area and resources better than anyone else, so in the absence of a better method of decision making, Basis gives ultimate decision power on determining stewardship of property and resources to local communities.
