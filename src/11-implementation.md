# Chapter 11: The start and growth of a socialist economy

Now that we have defined a plan for how our regional socialist economies operate, we need to have a plan for breathing life into the idea.

The plan is to create an ever-expanding "zone" of regional socialism starting with a core group of participants and moving out from there. Likely, the movement would start with one zone and would be set up legally as a co-op: all members of the co-op equally own all assets of the co-op. An articles of incorporation is written up such that:

- Anybody can join the co-op, and can do so without any transfer of assets to the co-op.
- All members of the co-op equally share ownership over all assets.
- All members of the co-op use the Conductor software and RSC currency for intra-co-op commerce.
- The RSC and USD exchange rate will be 1:1 initially to limit confusion with members (and this exchange rate may likely persist), although exchange rate can be set regionally. The co-op will always be able to back 1 RSC with 1 USD and vice versa (via reserves).
- Members can convert their personally-owned RSC to USD (and back again) at any time.
- Conductor software is kept up-to-date by all members.
- Members can leave the co-op at any time, but cannot remove any non-earned assets from the co-op ownership.
- (WIP) Co-op management is initially run by an unelected board of tyrants.
- Co-ops will have provisions to allow it to split, along with transfer of assets, into a new region based on various criteria. This might include splitting on various physical regions (city/county lines) or to avoid anti-trust disputes.

The goal is to create a legal entity that, through a process of acquiring profitable businesses, amasses an ever-growing pool of capital that allows it to expand and encompass a wide range of products and services. Ultimately, the goal is to reach a critical mass where almost anything needed by the members can be found within the co-op's internal economy, and anything that cannot be found within the co-ops's economy can be easily purchased outside of the economy (by spending RSC).

Counterpoint: how will "members" get paid in RSC if they are employees of the co-op? Wouldn't they require payment in USD? If so, that would break Conductor's model of controlling the (internal) flow of the currency.

## Phase 1 -- Initial stages and volunteer participation

WIP

Members of the co-op at this stage are dedicated to a socialist cause, and willing to work hard for this cause. They will set themselves up as "companies" in Conductor, and any income they derive outside of Conductor as a company will be converted to RSC and added to their company's profits, from which they can pay themselves an hourly rate the same as their capitalist rate (which will be taxed at some minimal amount). This income tax is what will feed the co-op's capital pool.

At this stage, Conductor will allow setting hourly rates per-company/per-worker, and members will be allowed to set the number of hours they worked manually (essentially emptying their company profit pool after each pay period). In an ideal world, hourly rates would be per-profession and decided democratically, and worker hours would be tracked by automated systems, but this would be suicidal in early stages. The survival of the system at this stage requires a near 1:1 match between capitalist wages and worker payment. If wages were to be equalized when the regional capital pool was too small and the products/services provided within the region were limited, the members making more would subsidize the ones making less, until the ones making more went bankrupt, and then all is lost. This stage is not set up to tackle income inequality.

After being paid by their company, members will be able to convert some or all of their RSC income back to USD automatically so they can participate with little-to-no effort.

The Conductor software will be tested and expanded as the members use it for the early stage purposes.

This stage is about controlled membership, testing, and refinement.

## Phase 2 -- Steady membership growth

WIP

Next, the region will seek out new members willing to donate a portion of their income and participate in the co-op. Hourly rates will still be highly-controlled at this rate. The security, growth, and scalability of the network will be tested.

Additionally, members will begin to advertise the services they can provide via Conductor. Members will be able to engage in commerce in-network.

A key point of this stage is to start working on automated solutions that bridge the region/capitalist barrier. For instance, a company that mirrors products on Amazon and allows purchasing via RSC (at-cost) would encourage spending of personal funds in-network, without converting to USD first. The more companies/services that could provide bridges to the surrounding capitalist system, the better.

This would be the beginning of the very early stages of economic growth, and intra-region commerce.

## Phase 3 -- Business acquisition and expansion of products/services

As the regional capital pool and membership grows, the co-op will encourage people to start engaging in Conductor-based commerce. This could be done by adjusting exchange rates such that $1 USD buys $1.05 RSC, creating an incentive for intra-region production.

As the capital pool grows via member taxation and increasing services offered, the co-op will start to turn toward acquisition of local businesses. The leadership of the co-op will plan and facilitate a series of acquisitions, out of the regional capital pool, of businesses that will support economic growth. This may be facilitated through slow and natural growth, or through capital injection from sympathetic individuals or nations.

After buying a business, the employees are offered membership in the co-op, and will be given the same wages to their previous position. Businesses bought will be required to use the Conductor system to publish job posting and products and for co-op-related business, however can use old systems when ordering products/services outside the collective (if there is no bridge-company providing those products). Businesses would be trained on collective ownership and be encouraged to set up their own internal structure. The idea is eventually the co-op would expand enough that businesses can conduct much of their transactions inside the economy and not externally.

The more businesses and assets the co-op owns, the more intra-co-op business can be conducted, providing a large network of products and services to members. Critical mass for participation is reached such that people outside the co-op will seek membership in order to gain access to job listings and in-region benefits.

## Phase 4 -- Basic needs

When the co-op reaches this point, it now has a steady source of capital inputs via co-op-owned businesses doing extra-region business, and intra-region business starts to be self-sustaining as a wealth of regional products and services grows. As the inputs outweigh the outputs, the growth of the co-op becomes more natural. The awkward, messy, and difficult process of gaining critical mass is complete. As growth of the regional capital pool happens, the co-op now seeks to acquire the means to provide basic needs.

The most important basic need at this point is housing. The co-op will begin to buy apartment complexes from its regional capital pool. Once housing is secured, and there is enough commerce within the region to support basic needs such as food, the wages of workers can start to be decided democratically instead of being approximations of the capitalist system from which they were originally derived.

There are still some expensive externalities, such as health care, which will not be met. The co-op will provide the option to "hire" members who conduct some percentage of their commerce in-region and provide a them group health insurance policy. This is in lieu of purchasing hospitals, which although they would be attractive targets for acquisition, would be prohibitively expensive.

## Phase 5 -- Natural growth and final economic stage

Once basic needs are met (and in the previous stage they will almost certainly be just that...basic) the regional socialism model will take over. All vestigial remnants of capitalist-wages will be abolished, and workers will be paid their wages according to their profession and productivity, via democratic decision within the co-op.

Regionally-owned facilities (schools, hospitals, commercial space, etc) would be provided at-cost. All worker wages and materials that run these facilities would be a matter of public record in Conductor, allowing fully-transparent public services. The region can decide how much of hospital costs or education costs it wants to subsidize.

Regional inventory (factories, commercial space, machinery, trucks for shipping, etc) would be queryable via Conductor and a matter of public record. Companies needing machinery (or other means of production) not provided by the region can petition the regional inventory collective for the funds to purchase, and if the company goes bankrupt, that equipment will be returned to the collective.

Growth at this point would be a natural progression. Purchase of land and construction of more housing and regionally-owned facilities would be decided democratically. Workers attracted by the success of the regional socialist economic model will no longer need artificial incentives to join.

Conductor's systems are fully matured and scale to support the economy running on top of it.

## Phase 6 -- Spread

The co-op has proven itself successful. Not just as a legal entity, but as a method of ushering in socialism within the confines of a hostile economic system.

Now, if it hasn't happened already, co-op delegates are sent to other municipalities and work to set up new co-ops. Because of the federated nature of regions, newly created regions will have many less growing pains as the first one: processes will be in place, incorporation papers will already exist, legal precedents will be set, software and networks will be fully matured, a wealth of products and services will be available.

And beyond all of this, it is hoped that the general public will begin to see the harmony in handing the production of society over to those who produce, instead of those who seek to extract personal gain at the expense of others.

## Phase 7 -- Complete integration

Once public opinion has shifted, and "socialism" is no longer a dirty word, and a number of co-ops have operated successfully for years (likely, many years), then is the time for the co-ops to dissolve and hand control of the assets and the economy to the local municipalities they were born out of.

There will still likely be capitalist pockets in each region, some even quite large, at this point. However, over time, their labor pool will likely shrink, forcing them to raise wages or throw up their arms in defeat, being slowly swallowed up.

The support for capitalism will have, at least in this physical region, withered to the point that the co-op is no longer needed as a legal shield to protect against corruption. The processes of transparency, public accountability, and pride in one's labor will supersede the level of greed that would be needed to corrupt the system. That's not to say corruption will wither away, however it will not be allowed to reach the critical mass needed to overturn the socialist economy and return to capitalism.

Much like you seldom hear the call for the return to feudalism, so will the call for capitalism slowly fade.
