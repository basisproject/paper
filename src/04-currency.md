# Chapter 4: Currency

Basis will use labor vouchers to pay members. However, this will be different from other proposals of this type of currency. Labor vouchers in this system are:

- An electronic, blockchain-based currency
- Distributed based on labor (hours worked * social value of that labor)
- Non-expiring
- Freely transferable between members
- Freely exchangeable into the outside market currency (for instance, USD) via the regional public bank at an exchange rate of `sum_of_all_existing_vouchers / liquid_assets_held_by_region`
- Destroyed when purchasing any product or service in a non-productive capacity (or when converting to market currency)

The only real difference between Basis' labor vouchers and any other currency is their destruction on purchase. This provides a barrier between the primary, productive economy and individual members such that members can take from the final productive output based on their input *while also* not requiring accounting between productive companies.
