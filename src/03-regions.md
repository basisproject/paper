# Chapter 3: Function of regions

Regions are the economic containers of regional socialism. They are managed by the people participating in the region, and define and automate various aspects of the economy.

Management of regional parameters and operations can be decided by direct democratic process, through elected representatives, or by various other methods. The exact process for governing regions won't be defined here, and will likely vary from region to region.

## Regional parameters

The regional parameters define various aspects for how the economy will work within the region. They will be defined in the Conductor system and managed either directly by the region's participants or by elected representatives.

All regional parameters will always be publicly available for review by any member of the region. The full list of regional parameters is as follows:

- Worker hourly wages (more on how this is defined in [Chapter 4](#wages-and-wage-calculations))
- Wage reduction dampening rate/delay
- Productivity rate value range (eg, between 0.5 and 1.5, or 0.8 and 1.2, etc)
- Sales tax percentage
- Income tax percentage
- Profits-at-rest taxation delay and percentage
- Regional bank investment allocation
- Healthcare subsidization
- Higher education subsidization
- Higher education wait-list prioritization
- Percentage of-cost to charge for apartments (90% would be a 10% subsidy, 110% would be a 10% apartment tax)
- Percentage of-cost to charge for duplex and house rental
- Board of director position appointments for various regionally-operated companies

## Regionally-operated companies

The region will operate a small amount of various types of companies. The main candidates for regional operation are:

- Banking
- Housing (and property management thereof)
- Healthcare
- Education

The idea is that the region will trend toward operating companies where parasitic profit-seeking is detrimental to society as a whole, focusing on regional welfare instead of amassing of capital.

All accounting for regionally-operated companies happens through Conductor, allowing detailed information on costs of running the company. This makes it easy to offer services at-cost (or some percentage of cost, with the region subsidizing the difference). It also allows ultimate transparency: any regional member can view the accounting of any regionally-operated company.

Regionally-operated companies are not necessarily restricted to servicing only regional members. For instance, if a region has excess space in an apartment complex, it may rent out the rooms to non-regional members at market rate (instead of at-cost). Of course, when the market-rate tenants find out their neighbors are paying significantly lower rents, they may decide to become members.

Members of the region will appoint a board of directors for each regional company. So while regionally-operated companies are not beholden to the rule of profit, they will still be accountable to members of the region (and as such will still strive to minimize costs). Board members will be paid a regionally-decided hourly wage, and will have all board-related expenses reimbursed (for travel or lodging, if required) through the company they govern. Boards will handle the appointment of company leadership and will oversee that the company faithfully executes the will of the region.

The board of directors for each regionally-operated company will self-govern using consensus such that:

- The board meets *at least* once every quarter.
- Any director can propose an idea or change (ideally advance notice is given before meetings).
- Proposals are discussed, along with their pros and cons, and updated based on feedback.
- Proposals are modified until everyone reaches an agreement. If agreement cannot be reached, the proposal returns to discussion.
- Even if just one director dissents, the proposal cannot move forward. Ultimately, after full discussion, disagreement must satisfy one of the following conditions:
  - The proposal will materially harm the company in the short or long term.
  - The proposal is materially opposed to the goals or spirit of the company.
  - The proposal is materially opposed to the wishes of the region/community.
  - The proposal is morally or legally unjustifiable.
- If a proposal is seen as immediately essential for a company's continued operation by over 75% of the board members, they can perform a majority vote to implement the proposal even if consensus is not reached.

This consensus mechanism, while intricate and lengthy, makes sure that various members of the board are able to have their expertise shared and acted on. This is in contrast to majority rule, which tends to silence certain important inputs to discussion.

Board members should be selected using a certain set of criteria, which will vary depending on the type of company.

## Capital, banking, and transparency

Regional taxation (income, sales, profits-at-rest) all generates regional income and is put into the regional bank. The regional bank allocates funds based on a regionally-decided set of allocations. See the [chapter on Banking](#chapter-5-banking-and-investment) for more information.

The regional bank is operated under the principles of transparency, which allows making highly informed decisions on just how much the region should subsidize or tax various operations. For instance, if the members of a region know it costs $4M a month to operate the regional hospital, they know it will cost $3M a month out of the region's capital pool to subsidize 75% of healthcare.

## Federation

While many parameters of the economy are regionally-defined, regions are able to engage in commerce and share much of their information via federation. For instance job postings, wages, purchasing of products and services, education, and housing will all be advertised on the federated network shared by connected regions.

This allows companies and people in various regions to engage in commerce with each other without barriers. It also allows someone to find a region that has the highest wages for work they might be interested in, and to see if in-region housing is available there.

Federation of regions allows transparency and freedom of movement.
