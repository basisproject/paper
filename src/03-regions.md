# Chapter 3: Function of regions

Regions are the economic containers of regional socialism. They are managed by the people participating in the region, and define and automate various aspects of the economy.

Management of regional parameters and operations can be decided by direct democratic process, through elected representatives, or by various other methods. The exact process for governing regions won't be defined here, and will likely vary from region to region.

## Regional parameters

The regional parameters define various aspects for how the economy will work within the region. They will be defined in the Conductor system and managed either directly by the region's participants or by elected representatives.

All regional parameters will always be publicly available for review by any member of the region. The full list of regional parameters is as follows:

- Worker hourly wages (more on how this is defined in Chapter 4)
- Wage reduction dampening rate/delay
- Productivity rate value range (eg, between 0.5 and 1.5, or 0.8 and 1.2, etc)
- Sales tax percentage
- Income tax percentage
- Profits-at-rest taxation delay and percentage
- Healthcare subsidization
- Higher education subsidization
- Higher education wait-list prioritization
- Percentage above-cost to charge for apartments (essentially an apartment tax)
- Percentage above-cost to charge for duplex and house rental (essentially a house-rental tax)
- UBI monthly payment amounts

## Regionally-operated companies

The region will operate a small amount of various types of companies. The main candidates for regional operation are:

- Housing
- Healthcare
- Education

The idea is that the region will trend toward operating companies where profit-seeking is detrimental to society as a whole.

All accounting happens through Conductor, allowing detailed information on costs of running the company. This makes it easy to offer services at-cost (or some percentage of cost, with the region subsidizing the difference). It also allows ultimate transparency: any regional member can view the accounting of any regionally-operated company.

Members of the region can appoint a director or board of directors for each regional company. So while regionally-operated companies are not beholden to the rule of profit, they will still be accountable to members of the region.

Regionally-operated companies are not necessarily restricted to regional members. For instance, if a region has excess space in an apartment complex, it may rent out the rooms to non-regional members at market rate (instead of at-cost). Of course, when the market-rate tenants find out their neighbors are paying significantly lower rents, they may decide to become members.

## Capital

Regional taxation (income, sales, profits-at-rest) all generates regional income and is put into the region's capital pool. What this capital is spent on will also be regionally-decided. Should healthcare be subsidized? Should sales tax be lowered? Members can adjust the parameters of the economy to tune the growth of the capital pool.

Regional capital, like regionally-operated companies, operates under full transparency. Any member of the region can see exactly how much is in the capital pool now and at all points in history. Being able to see historical data allows charting and more long-term decision making.

The transparency of the capital pool and regionally-operated companies allows making highly informed decisions on just how much the region should subsidize or tax various operations. For instance, if the members of a region know it costs $4M a month to operate the regional hospital, they know it will cost $3M a month out of the capital pool to subsidize 75% of healthcare.

## Federation

While many parameters of the economy are regionally-defined, regions are able to engage in commerce and share much of their information via federation. For instance job postings, wages, purchasing of products and services, education, and housing will all be advertised on the federated network shared by connected regions.

This allows companies and people in various regions to engage in commerce with each other without barriers. It also allows someone to find a region that has the highest wages for work they might be interested in, and to see if in-region housing is available there.

Federation of regions allows transparency and freedom of movement.
