# Chapter 5: Banking and investment

Funds from regional services and regional taxes will be stored in a regionally-owned "public" bank. In addition, all companies participating in the region must store their funds in the public bank. Not only will this bank hold the various forms of regional income, it will also be the region's primary lender. Companies will apply for loans from the public bank and the structure of the loan will reflect the risk of the venture.

The regional bank will be run by professional bankers, working under the "public banking" industry (allowing a distinction from private banking when setting regional wages).

The regional bank, like other regionally-owned companies, will be run by an elected board of directors. This board will have stipulations on its constituents:

- At least two directors must have banking experience.
- At least one member must have a legal background in finance or banking.
- At least one non-leadership bank employee.
- At least one member must be a compliance expert.

This board will make high-level decisions regarding the leadership and operations of the regional bank, and will be responsible for seeing the banking wills of the region fulfilled.

The bank's primary function will be economic development. It will value this over any profit, and as such, will be able to engage in delaying of loan payments or even debt fogiveness in extreme cases. The ultimate goal of the bank is to favor success of enterprises over accumulation of capital. Obviously, these goals need to be balanced such that the bank does not hemorrhage money.

## Allocation

The region itself will decide on a desired allocation of funds. For instance, the region may decide that it wants the regional bank to invest 30% of its funds in agriculture, 30% in energy technology, and allocate the remaining 40% at its discretion. It may also determine the overall risk: 50% of funds in stable loans, 30% in medium-risk loans, and 20% in the venture capital fund.

The regional allocation will also control subsidies. The region might decide that to attract new members, housing should not be at-cost but instead 80% of cost. It might decide that 70% of all medical costs should be subsidized. The regional bank will oversee these allocations to the various regional housing and health care companies.

It will be the job of the regional bank's board to see that the regional bank's actions matches the will of the region (within some acceptable threshold). The members of a board that allocates funds as desired while also making a modest profit will likely be re-appointed.

## Transparency

Although the loans made by the regional bank will be anonymized, the specific amounts of loans, the terms, and the industrial sectors the loans were allocated to will be publicly available information. All of the balances of the region's capital pool and each of the regionally-owned companies will be publicly viewable by members of the region.

## Bankruptcy

If a company goes bankrupt, the assets and collateral it owned will become property of the regional bank, which will then sell off or keep various assets depending on the mission. For instance, the regional bank may decide it wants to retain property but sell off all vehicles.

If a company is funded via a private bank or credit union within the region, the assets will be managed by that private institution.

## Venture capital

Because all companies are worker co-ops, selling ownership of a company will not be possible. However, the region will be able, through its regional bank, to provide a venture capital fund that invests in riskier enterprises on the condition that the companies will later pay dividends to the regional bank's venture program after a certain level of profitability is reached.

The value of dividends and the terms of the initial or ongoing investment will be at the discretion of the regional bank's venture program managers.

The goal of this arm of the bank is to engage in high-risk, high-payoff investments that the workers of the company would not otherwise be able to engage in, while sharing their success with the rest of the region.

## Private banking

The existence of a regional bank does not exclude in-region private banks from existing ("private" meaning banks started and run by regional members). Members of a region might want to start a credit union, or an entrepreneur with a background in finance might want to start a private bank that focuses on a particular segment of investment they think is missing from the regional bank's allocations.

As with all other regional companies, they must be worker co-ops, and profits are not able to be distributed to workers. Banks could, however, distribute this profit as interest or use it to reinvest into more loans.

## Outside funding

Companies are more than welcome to seek funding outside the region's banking system, provided their company structure follows the regional guidelines. It's hoped that most companies seek financial assistance from the public bank, but this is not a requirement.

That said, companies must still keep their funds in the regional public bank.
