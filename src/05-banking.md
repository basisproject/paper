# Chapter 5: Banking and investment

Funds from regional services and regional taxes will be stored in a regionally-owned "public" bank. Not only will this bank hold the various forms of regional income, it will also be the region's primary lender. Companies will apply for loans from the public bank and the structure of the loan will reflect the risk of the venture.

The regional bank will be run by professional bankers, working under the "public banking" industry (allowing a distinction from private banking when setting regional wages).

The regional bank, like other regionally-owned companies, will be run by an elected board of directors. This board will have stipulations on its constituents:

- At least two directors must have banking experience.
- At least one member must have a legal background in finance or banking.
- At least one non-leadership bank employee.
- At least one member must be a compliance expert.

This board will make high-level decisions regarding the leadership and operations of the regional bank, and will be responsible for seeing the banking wills of the region fulfilled.

## Allocation

The region itself will decide on a desired allocation of funds. For instance, the region may decide that it wants the regional bank to invest 30% of its funds in agriculture, 30% in energy technology, and allocate the remaining 40% at its discretion. It may also determine the overall risk: 50% of funds in stable loans, 30% in medium-risk loans, and 20% in the venture capital fund.

The regional allocation will also control subsidies. The region might decide that to attract new members, housing should not be at-cost but instead 80% of cost. It might decide that 70% of all medical costs should be subsidized. The regional bank will oversee these allocations to the various regional housing and health care companies.

It will be the job of the regional bank's board to see that the regional bank's actions matches the will of the region (within some acceptable threshold). The members of a board that allocates funds as desired while also making a modest profit will likely be re-appointed.

## Transparency

Although the loans made by the regional bank will be anonymized, the specific amounts of loans, the terms, and the industrial sectors the loans were allocated to will be publicly available information. All of the bank's holdings will be available as well.

## Bankruptcy

If a company goes bankrupt, the assets and collateral it owned will be seized by the regional bank, which will then sell off or keep various assets depending on the mission. For instance, the regional bank may decide it wants to retain property but sell off all vehicles.

If a company is funded via a private bank or credit union within the region, the assets will be managed by that private institution.

## Venture capital

Because all companies are owned by the region, selling ownership of a company will not be possible. However, the region will be able, through its regional bank, to provide a venture capital fund that invests in riskier enterprises on the condition that the companies will later pay dividends to the regional bank's venture program after a certain level of profitability is reached.

The value of dividends and the terms of the initial or ongoing investment will be at the discretion of the regional banks venture program managers.

## Private banking

The existence of a regional bank does not exclude in-region private banks from existing ("private" meaning banks started and run by regional members). Members of a region might want to start a credit union as a way to get interest return on their funds, or an entrepreneur with a background in finance might want to start a private bank that focuses on a particular segment of investment they think is missing from the regional bank's allocations.

As with all other regional companies, profits are not able to be distributed to workers and are taxed if left too long. Banks could distribute this profit as interest or use it to reinvest into more loans.

## Outside funding

Companies that choose to seek financing from banks outside the regional economy must be set up as subsidiaries to protect the region's assets from seizure. This will likely be a more intricate process than seeking capital from within the region, although it's possible this could be streamlined enough to be fairly cheap for both the region itself and the entrepreneur (who will be responsible for all filing fees).

The legal process of this will be managed by an arm of the regional bank.
