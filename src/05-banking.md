# Chapter 5: Banking and investment

Funds from regional services and regional taxes would be stored in a regionally-operated "public" bank. Not only would this bank hold the various forms of regional income, it would also be the region's primary lender. Companies would apply for loans from the public bank and the structure of the loan would reflect the risk of the venture.

The regional bank would be run by professional bankers, working under the "public banking" industry (allowing a distinction from private banking when setting regional wages).

If a company goes bankrupt, the assets and collateral would be seized by the regional bank, which would then sell off or keep various assets depending on the mission. For instance, the regional bank may decide it wants to retain property but sell off all vehicles.

## Governance

The regional bank, like other regionally-operated companies, would be run by a regionally-elected director. This director would likely have a background in banking and would make high-level decisions regarding the structure and operations of the regional bank, and would be responsible for executing the financial will of the region.

## Allocation

The region itself would decide on a desired allocation of funds. For instance, the region may decide that it wants the regional bank to invest 30% of its funds in agriculture, 30% in energy technology, and allocate the remaining 40% at its discretion. It may also determine the overall risk: 50% of funds in stable loans, 30% in medium-risk loans, and 20% in the venture capital fund.

The regional allocation would also control subsidies. The region might decide that to attract new members, housing should not be at-cost but instead 80% of cost. It might decide that 70% of all medical costs should be subsidized. The regional bank would oversee these allocations to the various regional housing and health care companies.

It would be the regional bank director's job to see that the regional bank's actions matches the will of the region (within some acceptable threshold). A director that allocates funds as desired while also making a modest profit would likely be re-appointed.

## Transparency

Although the loans made by the regional bank would be anonymized, the specific amounts of loans, the terms, and the industrial sectors the loans were allocated to would be publicly available information. All of the bank's holdings would be available as well.

## Private equity and venture capital

Because all companies are owned by the region, selling ownership of a company would not be possible. However, the region would be able, through its regional bank, to provide a venture capital fund that invests in riskier enterprises on the condition that the companies would later pay dividends to the regional bank's venture program after a certain level of profitability is reached.

The value of dividends and the terms of the initial or ongoing investment would be at the discretion of the regional banks venture program managers.

## Outside funding

Companies that choose to seek financing from banks outside the regional economy must be set up as subsidiaries to protect the region's assets from seizure. This will likely be a more intricate process than seeking capital from within the region, although it's possible this could be streamlined enough to be fairly cheap for both the region itself and the entrepreneur (who would be responsible for all filing fees).

## Private banking

The existence of a regional bank does not exclude private banks from existing. Members of a region might want to start a credit union as a way to get interest return on their funds, or an entrepreneur with a background in finance might want to start a private bank that focuses on a particular segment of investment they think is missing from the regional bank's allocations.
