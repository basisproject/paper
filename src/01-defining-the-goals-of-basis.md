# Chapter 1: Defining the goals of Basis

Basis is at its core a cost-tracking economic networking system that seeks to socialize property and empower its members with self-determination. It strives to strike a balance between being specific enough to support a socialist mode of production and the welfare of its members, while being general enough to model a large number of social and economic arrangements. It's not a detailed blueprint for society but rather a set of tools by which society might organize itself around.

Let's go over some of the key goals of Basis.

## Membership

Membership of the system is controlled by policies set by current members. In general, a member of the system is a person who works at a member company, and member companies generally can join (or be created) under the conditions that they:

- Are a worker-owned company or multi-stakeholder company where the workers have significant representation
- Use Basis for their transactional system and labor time tracking

Membership is not binary, but rather is a sliding scale decided by the number of hours worked at a member company. With more participation comes higher voting rights and more use of shared resources, such as housing.

## Companies

A company in Basis is a somewhat general concept. It can be a traditional producer co-op in that it is an entity with members who are workers, but a company can also have members who are other companies.

So you might have ten companies that produce food, and all those companies might be members of a larger company that stewards farm land, tractors, and other resources farmers might need. There might also be a housing company that members of a region join to get access to housing.

Companies are effectively self-managed groups or networks of people within the larger Basis network.

## Economics

There are a few main facets to the economics of Basis that all work in tandem together to create a healthy internal ecosystem that self-tunes for growth and member prosperity.

### Cost tracking

Cost tracking is the process of accounting for all the disaggregate labor and resources that go into products and services produced in-network. What does this mean? It means that a chair no longer costs $30, but rather 1.8 hours of labor, 12 kg wood, 3g steel, and 0.4l diesel fuel.

Why do things this way? Why not just tally up the costs of everything and give a final number? Because the final number will have erased all of the costs involved in production.

When we have a disaggregate list of costs for each product, producers, consumers, and governments can know the *exact* costs of something, as opposed to just *the market cost*. Fans of capitalism say that pricing allows you to compare the cost of two different things. They're right in that prices as aggregate values allow easy comparison, but they're also wrong because *prices don't reflect costs*. Prices are arbitrary and meaningless, whereas costs are absolute.

Basis allows tracking of *costs* of production, retaining information about the labor, resources, and to some extent the externalities it takes to make something.

### Raw material tracking and costing

Cost tracking for labor is somewhat straightforward: members track their labor when engaging in production, and are then compensated for their labor in credits. That credit amount is then added to the costs of the company they work for and ultimately assigned to products they make. This is similar to money. Things get interesting when we start talking about costs of resources.

First of all, which resources? Iron? Steel? Oil? Jet fuel? These might be obvious. What about chairs or widgets? Ultimately *which* resources are tracked is a globally-democratic decision, decided by the members.

Secondly, how much are these resources valued? In order for members to exchange credits for products, we need to be able to determine the credit value, per-standard-unit, of each resource. This is where our global and regional resource plans come into play.

### Pricing

The *total cost* of a product, in credits (₡), is a function of not just how much labor went into creating that product, but the resources (such as raw materials) and the socially-decided credit value per-unit for each of those resources. In other words, if it cost the network 15 credits to build a chair, the base cost would be 15 credits, but if it has 2kg wood and wood is systemically valued at 0.003₡/g, then the final credit-cost of the chair might be `15 + (2000 * 0.0003)`, or 21₡.

Now, while the system incentivizes (via cybernetics) setting the price of products at-cost, pricing for consumers is somewhat fluid: a product might *cost* 10₡ to produce, but the final price might be set lower or higher to clear inventory (if its cost is too high) or to control inventory (if demand is much higher than supply). It's important to note that the company the product is purchased from *does not realize any losses or gains from price fluctuations* and instead the delta between cost and price is used as a productive signal (ie, "produce less" or "produce more") which is enforced by the cybernetics system.

### Cybernetics

Given that productive companies don't use prices and profits to determine their existence, it follows that some other system comes into play that can make this determination. This is the role of cybernetics: each company has a cost ceiling above which they cannot take on more costs (without transferring them to another entity) and this cost ceiling is adjusted by an ongoing systemic process that works to optimize the *overall network health*.

The idea here is that companies that operate in the best interests of the network are rewarded by commanding higher amounts of costs (which might be thought of as purchasing power in capitalism), and companies acting against the interests of the network get a lower cost ceiling, and thus have less social investment.

### Public market

The public market is a place where members (both companies and individuals) can publish and order each others products and services. In a sense, the public market is like a big worker-owned Amazon.com that uses your incoming and outgoing orders to determine your costs of production.

When member companies order from each other, no money is involved in the transaction. Rather, costs flow from one company to the other. This means that that the larger the network of member companies grows, the easier it is to produce *without relying on traditional capital*.

When individual members (consumers) order something, the transaction is obfuscated and anonymized, and the credits (earned through labor) they spend on the purchase are immediately destroyed.

## Banking

Banking forms the translation layer between the network's socialist mode of production and the outside capitalist markets. It allows member companies to buy inputs to production that are not available in-network, but also allows individual members to exchange their internal currency (credits) for market currency (such as USD).

This translation layer is absolutely essential to Basis. It forms a protective barrier around the network that shields it from the relations of capitalism, and also works together with the cost tracking system to optimize for profit when conducting transactions in capitalist markets.

It's important to note that banking is somewhat transitional: when the network grows large enough that most of the products and services desired by members can be produced in-network, banking becomes less and less important.

## Credit system

In exchange for labor, credits are printed and transferred to workers. How many credits per-hour or per-year is a decision made between the worker and the company, and is effectively the same as a wage in a market system.

When credits are spent (exchanged for products or services), they are destroyed. This way, they do not enter the productive economy but rather only serve as a means to track a member's contribution.

### Universal Basic Income

All members receive a periodic payment, printed by the system, into a special account they own. This "basic income" can be used to pay for any in-network expenses, such as housing, food, or any other in-network product.

## Management of property and resources

All property and resources in the network are owned by the network as a whole (and thus, by all members equally). However, it doesn't make sense for every single member to be involved in every single decision about property and resource management. Basis provides a framework for determining the stewardship and use of these resources in ways that work for the local participants. In other words, we don't force a one-size-fits-all approach to resource management, but rather give tools for people to figure it out themselves in a transparent and self-determined manner.

## Governance

What good is the communal ownership of resources or worker-controlled production if you cannot exercise any sort of control? Basis allows various types of elections or consensus-based processes so members can define their own systems of governance.

This ranges from voting for people for specific permissions and positions in the system to voting for changing economic parameters.

## Public companies/projects

At some point, it's conceivable that this system might grow to large numbers of members. These members might want to have public services and infrastructure. It makes sense to define the ability to create companies that have some amount of their costs subsidized by taxes.

Examples might be hospitals, schools, bridges, pharmaceutical research, space exploration, etc.

## Duality

Basis is a system of duality. The network incentivizes providing products and services to members at-cost, while also incentivizing charging market-rate (at-profit) to non-members. This duality is the main vector for the system's growth. If you want the benefits of membership, you have to join the system.
