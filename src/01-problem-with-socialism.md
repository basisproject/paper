# Chapter 1: The problem with socialism

"What is socialism?" It's a question that's been asked over and over again, and usually the answers prompt only more questions. The idea is entirely fractured among different sects of people. Between those who self-identify as socialists, it means wildly different things. To many others, it means "anything that's not complete unregulated market-based capitalism."

Anyone who has read socialist literature will know the feeling of being bombarded less with technical theory or detailed plans, but more so with endless complaints against capitalism accompanied with many "shoulds" and "coulds".

When it comes down to it, socialism could be thought of as a fundamental difference in the concept of property rights. In capitalism, property rights are clearly defined by private ownership and a protective legal system. In socialism, productive property is owned by the workers. How is this ownership defined, however? What is the relationship between an individual worker (or group of workers) and the productive property?

The problem with socialism is that the goals it describes are idealized concepts and not concrete definitions.

## Owning the means of production

Workers should own the means of production. It sounds nice! The people who do a task are in full control of what they produce and how. What does this mean, though?

In the USSR, it meant a non-elected bureaucracy controlled the means of production. Given that the people had little say, wouldn't this mean that the workers did not actually own the means of production? Central planning is thought of by many to be synonymous with socialism (and why not, after you remove markets, how would an economy operate without planning?). However, central planning, when executed by a state bureaucracy not controlled by the population or the workers, is not really workers controlling their own destiny.

The idea of worker-owned production is itself a contentious idea in socialism. In market socialism, workers own their co-ops and compete against each other in a capitalist manner. In state socialism, the state owns the means of production and hires the workers to execute its will. In other forms of socialism, workers form guilds or unions and decide what to produce collectively.

I will outline a system where enterprises are community-owned, run by the workers of the enterprise, and operate in a decentralized manner that uses profit as an economic feedback system while not allowing capital hoarding.

## Production and markets

Many socialists are afraid of the term "market." It's usually used in conjunction with capitalism. However, a market doesn't necessarily mean the exploitation of workers, and it's an idea that's almost completely glossed over in socialist literature.

A market is a method and means of exchanging goods and services. In the case of socialism, the workers may own the means of production (for whatever nebulous definition various theories provide), but how are they to exchange their goods and services to other workers or consumers?

They do it via markets. Even a centrally planned economy is still a market, but the parameters of the market are tightly controlled by a small group of people (whether democratically elected or not).

Socialism doesn't provide a model for working markets, though, and so various socialist factions are left to define this themselves, some of them based only on such loose concepts as "workers and consumers will form organizations and decide what to produce" or "the economy will be planned democratically." The theories are endlessly vague.

There has to be a way, however, to decide who builds what, and how it is distributed. To some, this involves large unions and interest groups deciding through spokespeople or democratically-elected leadership. To others, it means a supercomputer that tells every person exactly where they should be and exactly what they should be doing. Or perhaps a capitalist market with worker-owned co-ops.

I will define a working market system that neither requires top-down planning, nor allows exploitation of the workers, all while still allowing entrepreneurship, competition, and innovation.

## Attaining socialism

How do we get our utopian socialist society? Even in the definition, "the workers seize the means of production," the word "seize" implies to take. It implies revolution, and this thinking can be fairly prevalent in socialist circles.

How, though, do you break old patterns and establish a new vision of society after fighting a bloody revolution? Who takes charge, and what kind of people are they? Even if you have a concrete plan of execution, how is it fully and completely realized in the chaos of rebuilding without corruption? Will those who lead the revolution willingly give up power after constructing the socialist paradise? Or will they remain in charge just until the revolution is complete (which it never quite is)?

I would argue revolution, except in rare cases, is an effective way to remove those in power, but almost never a viable means of attaining meaningful transformation.

Beyond just revolution, many have stated that socialism can only truly exist as a global phenomena. I would argue that if socialism cannot compete and win against a capitalist system after gaining a critical mass of support and participation, then it is truly an inferior model. That's not to say the birth of a practicing socialist movement won't be extremely difficult -- even seemingly impossible at some points -- but in the end, I believe *the productive capacity of those who do what they do because they love doing it will always win against those who do what they do because they will starve if they do not*.

I will outline a method for achieving socialism within the confines of a capitalist system such that it can happen today, and not exist as some distant fantasy that requires bloodshed.
