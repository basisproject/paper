# Chapter 2: Regions

While Factor is designed to provide one large economic network, it segments members regionally. Why the regional approach? It comes down to human nature. Nobody likes someone else telling them how to live their life. However, it's usually much worse when the person doing so lives far away and has no idea what life is like for people here.

Economic decisions should reflect the needs of communities, not some state planning board from some distant land. Regions are set up such that people participating in the region set the parameters of their own economy to suit their needs.

Management of regional parameters and operations can be decided by direct democratic process, through elected representatives, or by various other methods. The exact process for governing regions won't be defined here, and will likely vary from region to region. Factor will strive to provide as many tools as is practical for various methods of management, but will also not force any given structure on members. Ultimately, Factor is an economic system that requires some governance, not a governance system in general, and this will be reflected in its set of features.

## Regional parameters

The regional parameters define various aspects for how the economy will work within the region. They will be defined in the Factor system and managed either directly by the region's members or by elected representatives.

All regional parameters will always be publicly available for review by any member of the region. The full list of regional parameters is as follows:

- Worker hourly wages (more on how this is defined in [Chapter 4](#wages-and-wage-calculations))
- Worker minimum average weekly hours to be considered members
- Wage reduction dampening rate/delay
- Wage productivity rate value range
- Distribution plans for regional profits
- Subsidies and budgets for regional services (hospitals, schools, etc)
- Board of directors position appointments for regionally-owned companies
- Length in number of months of board of directors appointments
- Monthly social dividend percentage (of total regional profits)
- Percentage between at-cost and market rate to charge members of other regions who are using this region's services (housing, schooling, etc), decided on a per-sister-region basis

## Governance

Since each region will be set up as a co-op, some form of governance needs to be defined. Although the goal is to have many decisions made by democratic vote, there will still need to be high-level leadership to manage certain things such as region splitting, coordination with other regions, oversight of regionally-owned companies, and overall maintenance of the system.

The governing board of the regional co-op corporation will be known as the Regional Council. The members of the region will democratically elect two-thirds of this board, with the other third are elected by direct employees of the co-op.

The Regional Council will select the overall leadership and will be ultimately responsible for the oversight of all regional things that are not democratically decided by the members.

## Duties of the region

The mission of the regional co-op company will be to:

- Coordinate and mediate between the regionally-owned companies
- Provide education and guidance to new companies
- Facilitate elections and hold meetings with members of the region
- Foster a sense of community between all the members in the region
- Facilitate regional joining or splitting
- Coordinate and cooperate with other regions on issues relating to infrastructure, housing, and services

## Membership

In order to be a member of the region, you must be a worker for a company that has regional membership, and you must work at least an average of N hours a week (N being regionally decided). It's important to note that this value should take into account time off (vacation, sick days, etc).

It's important to note that this takes into account total hours worked. In other words, if the minimum is 25 hours a week, then someone who works 25 hours a week is a member even if they split their hours between two or more regional companies via part-time employment.

WIP: need a membership grace period for unemployment (quit, fired, injured, etc).

### Regionally-owned companies

The region will operate a small amount of various types of companies. The main candidates for regional operation are:

- A public bank, which acts as the interface with the outside market systems. It accounts for all capital held by the region, and facilitates exchanges between internal currency and external currency
- A means of production company which buys, builds, sells, maintains, and oversees the usage of the regionally-owned office buildings, warehouses, factories, and larger machinery
- A housing company, tasked with acquisition and maintenance of various forms of housing

The idea is that the region will trend toward operating companies where parasitic profit-seeking is detrimental to society as a whole, focusing on regional welfare instead of amassing of capital. This serves two purposes: to allow members to adjust their own cost of living and to attract outsiders to participate (by driving costs downwards for members through the removal of profit).

All accounting for regionally-owned companies happens through Factor, allowing detailed information on costs of running the company. This makes it easy to offer services at-cost. It also allows ultimate transparency: any regional member can view the accounting of any regionally-owned company.

Regionally-owned companies are not necessarily restricted to servicing only regional members. For instance, if a region has excess space in an apartment complex, it may rent out the rooms to non-regional members at market rate (instead of at-cost). The regional college may enroll students who are not members and charge them much higher tuition. In these situations, all extra profits go to the regional bank which disperses funds internally based on democratically-decided distribution plans (buying more housing, social dividend, etc).

Each regionally-owned company will have an elected board of directors governing it. The boards of each individual company will be democratically selected as follows:

- All members of the region will elect one-half of the board
- The workers of the regionally-owned company will elect the other half of their own board
- In cases where the board requires an odd number of seats, the regional members will select the odd board member

With this setup, regionally-owned companies will be accountable to both members of the region and to the workers in the company.

## Board details

Board elections for all boards (including the Regional Council) will be held every N months (N being decided regionally).

Board members will be paid a regionally-decided hourly wage when they are meeting, and will have all board-related expenses reimbursed (for travel or lodging, if required) through the company they govern. Boards will handle the appointment of company leadership and will oversee that the company faithfully executes the will of the region.

The president of each company will sit on the board of the company as a non-voting, advisory member.

Boards will self-govern using consensus such that:

- The board meets *at least* once every quarter.
- Any director can propose an idea or change (ideally advance notice is given before meetings).
- Proposals are discussed, along with their pros and cons, and updated based on feedback.
- Proposals are updated and modified until everyone reaches an agreement. If agreement cannot be reached, the proposal returns to discussion.
- Even if just one director dissents, the proposal cannot move forward. Ultimately, after full discussion, disagreement must satisfy one of the following conditions:
  - The proposal will materially harm the company in the short or long term.
  - The proposal is in material opposition to the goals or spirit of the company.
  - The proposal is in material opposition to the wishes of the region/community.
  - The proposal is morally or legally unjustifiable.
- If a proposal is seen as immediately essential for a company's continued operation, then a vote can be called and if over 75% agree to the proposal, it is accepted even if full consensus is not reached.

This consensus mechanism, while intricate and lengthy, makes sure that various members of the board are able to have their expertise shared and acted on. This is in contrast to majority rule, which tends to silence certain important inputs to discussion.

Board members should be selected using a certain set of criteria, which will vary depending on the type of company.

## Federation

While many parameters of the economy are regionally-defined, regions are able to engage in commerce and share much of their information via federation. For instance job postings, wages, purchasing of products and services, education, and housing will all be advertised on the federated network shared by connected regions.

This allows companies and people in various regions to engage in commerce with each other without barriers. It also allows someone to find a region that has the highest wages for work they might be interested in, and to see if in-region housing is available there.

Federation of regions allows transparency and freedom of movement.

### Coordination with other regions

Coordination between regions is important not just for obvious reasons (for instance, building a bridge over a river separating the two regions) but for more nuanced problems. 
Let's say someone lives in the Saint Paul region, but they get a new job in the Minneapolis region. In other words, they are not truly a member of the Saint Paul region anymore because they no longer work in that region. Should they now have to pay market-rate for their housing in St. Paul? The answer depends on if the two regions have coordinated and decided how to handle this situation. It might be that St. Paul charges *some price between at-cost and market-rate* to Minneapolis regional members. Or they both might decide that they let all their members use all their housing at-cost.

Factor will allow setting up these rules between regions such that it's automated and transparent to members who wish to see what costs would be if they were to find employment in another region (and not just housing, but health care, schooling, etc).

The premise is, membership is a function of where someone works, but regions can coordinate between themselves to offer services to members of other regions if there is a desire to do so.
