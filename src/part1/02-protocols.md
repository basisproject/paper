## Chapter 2: The Basis protocol

There's a somewhat unexplored space between a planned economy and a capitalist market system. The positive attributes of planning -- democratic participation and production for use (as opposed to production *for profit*) -- can exist alongside the best part of a market system: autonomous distributed production. Basis is an analysis of this space; a non-authoritarian journey into the intersection of democratic production, ecology, and free association.

At its core, Basis is a protocol that defines a transactional economic fabric and provides detailed cost tracking on top of this fabric. It allows agents of an economic network to order products and services from each other in a way that automatically accounts for labor and resource content much more accurately than money and prices. As a result, all products output by this network have not just a list of all the different occupation hours/wages that went into producing them but also details on the resources used and by what quantities. All productive transactions in this network are transparent to participants. This means for any given product, anybody can see its entire supply chain: what companies were involved, what wages were paid, where the resources were originally sourced, and more.

Basis also defines a currency system, the ability to democratically price resources independently of their extraction costs (for instance, participants might democratically raise the price of fossil fuels as a mechanism for lowering their usage globally), and the means for determining use of property *outside of market mechanisms.*

Lastly, in Part 3 of this paper, we will explore not just the described system as a big fat what-if but also the path to transition from *here* to *there* and many of the mechanisms that will get us there.
