# Part 1: Introduction

## Chapter 1: On capitalism, and why alternatives are needed

As various parts of our modern economic system inevitably fail, it will be important to quickly find alternatives. This paper, and the system it describes, is a step in the direction of finding new modes of relating to each other in a way that balances self-determination, personal fulfillment, and ecology.

When asked the question "What is capitalism?" some might say it's a system of distributed production. Or a set of property relations. However, in the more general sense, it's an economic protocol.

You "own" a thing. You rent it to others. They buy things and transform them into new things. If they sell the new things for more than the cost of buying and transforming them, they win. If they sell for less, they lose. The protocol itself is almost painfully simple.

Yet hidden in this simple protocol is world of complexity. The driving force of profit -- selling things for more than it *cost* to make them -- has the side-effect of incentivizing pushing the *costs* involved in producing things *onto other people*. This could be anything from dumping toxic waste into a river to selling products that are designed to fail after a year. When your systemic survival as an economic entity depends on making one number go higher than another one, most entities will do just that regardless of the negative effects suffered by those around them. There's another effect to this as well. If one entity decides it wants to *do the right thing* and not externalize its costs onto the rest of society, it now has to compete with other entities who *do externalize their costs*. This might work if wealth distribution were even enough for consumers to make informed, responsible decisions, but more often than not distribution is uneven and people are forced to think in terms of personal survival much more than the greater good. Economic entities that take more wholistic approaches to production are often forced into obscurity by the forces of competition and uneven wealth distribution.

Capitalism actively incentivizes externalities both individually and systemically. And so, although praised for its simplicity and effectiveness, more complex systems must grow out of capitalism as control mechanisms. In a sense, *capitalism itself is only simple because it externalizes its complexity onto those who are subject to it*. Now we have governments and states that work tirelessly to not just counteract the negative externalities of capitalism, but to resist (with limited effectiveness) the onslaught of the holders of capital who wish to see restrictions lifted and more wealth diverted toward them. On top of this, these states also need to enforce another quite expensive aspect of capitalism: absentee ownership of property. In effect, this is the ability to exercise ultimate control over something you've never once used in a productive or even personal capacity. Simple in theory, complex and expensive to enforce in reality.

What's needed is a more balanced approach to economics. There are very important aspects of capitalism (or markets in general) that are worth preserving, such as the ability to act as a distributed signal processing mechanism. However, this paper will show that distributed economic signal processing can be done *without* profit and without absentee ownership of property. It will also outline more effective methods of signal processing than simple prices.
