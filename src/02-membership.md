# Chapter 2: Membership

Membership in Basis is controlled by a few system-wide policies, and after that, by policies set by the members of various companies in the system. The global policy is fairly simple: membership is only given to companies that are worker-owned or are multi-stakeholder companies with a significant portion owned by the workers, and member companies must use the Basis system for their selling, purchasing, and labor time tracking.

Workers of a member company are automatically members.

## Member benefits

Members of the system have access to the resources in possession of the companies they are members of, and also can access all internal products and services at-cost.

What does this mean? If a housing company is steward to an apartment building, members of that company can use it freely provided they collectively cover the costs of that resource (which might be property taxes, insurance, and maintenance). In other words, the housing company has no mechanism by which to extract profit from members for use of its resources. This applies to not just housing, but commercial property, large machinery, and anything else companies are stewards of.

Members are given use of these assets, and while they are in use, are given control. So in our apartment example, if ten members share an apartment building, there is no landlord...those ten members *are* their own landlord and must set their own building rules, organize repairs, decide what portion of the expenses each of them pay (perhaps by number of bedrooms or square footage), and/or delegate these decisions to one of themselves or a third party (who might be compensated their time and labor as a portion of the cost of the apartment building).

## Key management (WIP)

- Methods to recover lost keys / identity management

## Governance and voting rights

All members have voting rights in the system. They may vote on issues related to the various companies they are members of, or systemic properties in general.

## Member wallets

Members will have one or more "wallets" that stores their credits (more about this in chapter 6) which they can use to spend on goods and services in the Basis economy.

Members will also have one UBI wallet where their basic income is periodically transferred.

## Loss of membership

As membership can be given based on global and regional policy, it can also be revoked. For instance, a worker co-op that converts to a privately-owned corporation would lose membership in the system.

Instead of forfeiting use of all network-owned assets, the region would simply engage in profit-extraction. For instance, if the company uses an office building, it is no longer provided at-cost, but rather at market-rate, and same for any housing used by the company members: they would have to start paying rent at market rate.

Thus there is an economic incentive to abide by the rules of the system.
