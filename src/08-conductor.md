# Chapter 8: Conductor

For now, this is just a high-level list of operations Conductor will need to facilitate:

- Creation of companies
- Listing/discovery of products and services
- Purchase of products and services
  - Purchase includes service contract
- Direct transfer of money between individuals
- Hourly wages
- Income tax
- Profit-at-rest taxation
- MoP rent payment automation
- Coordination of regional services across regions:
  - Subsidies: a worker lives in region X but works in region Y. If X subsidizes housing at 50% and Y subsidizes at 5%, there needs to be coordination so Y does not drain X's resources
  - Pools/services: two regions may want to pool a set of resources to provide a service neither of them can individually afford
- 

Stretch goals:

- Housing rent payment automation (must be opt-in)
- Loan automation
  - Issuing
  - Repayment/amortization
  - Forgiveness
- Elections
  - Yes/no (referendum)
  - Average (taxation/subsidy percentages, wage parameters)
  - STV/Cumulative/Approval (board members)
