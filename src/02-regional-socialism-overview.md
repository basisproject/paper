# Chapter 2: Regional socialism: an overview

Given our our problems, our solutions, and the goals used to reach those solutions, let's define exactly what this system looks like.

We'll be terse and start with a set of definitions and objectives:

- A region is any group of people who decide to associate with each other using this economic system, generally within a geographic location. A region can be a city or county, or even a network of people within a capitalist-operating city.
- A region is defined legally as co-operative corporation. The owner-members of the co-op will be the employees of the regional companies that are participating.
- Production and its tools (factories, offices, machines, etc) are regionally/collectively-owned.
- Companies are the economic drivers of the region, and anybody can start a company.
- Companies are co-ops (worker-owned) and rent productive equipment/facilities from the region at-cost (the ongoing cost of maintenance). If the region is missing facilities or equipment the company needs, they may build or acquire it as needed.
- Company structure (hierarchy, collective, etc) is decided by workers, and decisions can be made collectively or delegated to managers (hiring, firing, spending decisions, etc).
- A distributed, electronic system (called "Factor") is used to manage productive resources, including automatically paying wages, facilitating exchange between companies, managing costs, and managing social resources.
- Company products are priced automatically via Factor. The prices are set such that averaged over time, the products ordered equal the costs of operating the business. In other words, pricing is set such that *things cost exactly what it costs to make them*.
- Companies don't "buy" inputs for their productive process from each other. Instead, they order them, and the cost of those products are added to the company's overall costs for their current cycle, and will be priced into *their* productive outputs.
- Companies have a reserve pool which wages, productive inputs, and other costs are deducted from. The reserve pool is replenished by fulfilling orders from other companies or consumers. Using this method, companies can only pay workers if they are meeting some social need/want.
- Companies have an initial starting pool used to relieve costs of starting inventories and equipment. Costs coming out of this pool *do not* factor into the costs of the products (otherwise products would initially be prohibitively expensive).
- Initial values of reserve/starting pools for any company are regionally-defined.
- A regional bank, run by democratically-elected board members, has the ability to increase the reserve pool and starting capital of companies that request it. This setup allows automating some level of economic autonomy for companies while also introducing levels of social consensus to approve larger operating costs.
- If a company goes bankrupt, its assets become the property of the region.
- Workers are paid an hourly rate based on productivity, training required, regional need, physical/mental stress, etc (productivity being decided by peers and/or industry standards if measurable, and the other wage factors being regionally-decided). Productivity rate acts to set a range of wages for each occupation, and the amount of range is regionally-decided per-occupation.
- Payment is automatically deducted from the company reserve pool and transferred to workers hourly.
- Payment is in the form of an electronic currency. When items are bought using it, the currency is destroyed.
- Regionally-owned companies can be created and subsidized at some regionally-decided amount. The board of any subsidized company would have some percentage of the board members democratically-elected by members of the region (with the remainder of the board being selected by the workers of the company).
- Apartments are regionally-owned and rented out at-cost, or some regionally-decided percentage above cost (cost being property tax, maintenance, and administration). Housing is wait-listed, allowing collective measure of demand.
- Home ownership is not restricted or managed by the region, although if more regional housing is desired, homes may be purchased by the region and rented out.

Another thing you may notice is that a lot of things happen in the above model as if by clockwork (workers are paid hourly from the company pool, products and jobs are listed, etc). The goal of this model of socialism is not to just provide a blueprint, but to actually provide the open-source software that will be used as the backbone of its functioning. Things like tracking workers' hours, buying and selling products and services, job listings, etc will all be tracked in this distributed software system that lets not only people participating in a region engage in commerce, but also lets people in different regions engage via a federated network. In other words, someone from the San Francisco region will be able to see job listings in the New York region, and a Houston region company can see and buy products from a Minneapolis region company.

Because it tracks work hours (along with wages) and inputs (products bought needed to supply a company) of regionally-owned companies (hospitals, schools, etc), it can account for exactly how much things cost to run, and can provide services to their customers at-cost.

Let's tackle a few key concepts.

## Regions

Why the regional approach? It comes down to human nature. Nobody likes someone else telling them how to live their life. However, it's usually much worse when the person doing so lives far away and has no idea what life is like for people here.

Economic decisions should reflect the needs of communities, not some state planning board from some distant land. Regions are set up such that people participating in the region set the parameters of their own economy to suit their needs.

## Open-source Software ("Factor")

Those who opt-in to regional socialism will also be opting to use the software, named "Factor," that manages various aspects of the economy. This software will be open-source and available to the public for review and for (controlled) modification.

The software will define the many operations that can take place in the economy, and over time these operations will expand. It will tracks the number of worker hours. It will automate the transfer of company reserve pools to worker accounts, the pricing of products, the waitlisting of schools and apartments, and many other economic operations. It will facilitate purchasing via a payment and product network. It will allow management of specific attributes such as hourly wages, profit-at-rest taxation levels, etc. It will provide various levels of permissions control, such that only specific people can do specific tasks, sometimes requiring approval from multiple people to perform an action.

The purpose of Factor is not just to establish consensus on policies and operations, but to lower the barrier to entry for many tasks people and companies will be performing on a constant basis. And beyond that, its goal is to be so good at what it does, that to not use it isn't just inconvenient, it's expensive.

The platform will exist as a set of tools to make regional socialism cheaper to operate.
