# Factor whitepaper

It's important to note there are two major version of this paper.

One, the original, is a market-based model that derives use-values of products via market forces by placing limitations on how company profits can be spent.

The second, which is currently in-progress (on the `labor-costs` branch), uses a similar model, but accounts for inputs/outputs of companies more closely and uses a labor voucher system.
