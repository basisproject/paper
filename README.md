# Factor whitepaper

This is a huge work in progress. The original version of this project was built on top of a market system and called "regional socialism." It has close ties to mutualism (probably). It can be found on [the regional-socialism.market-model](https://gitlab.com/factor-/whitepaper/tree/regional-socialism.market-model.v1).

The current, in-progress version is going to be based on more of a collectivist-anarchist model: products are priced at the average cost to produce them, jobs are paid via labor tokens, different jobs have different wages (depending on skill, danger, stress, etc), the only inter-company accounting is need-based, means of production and (a lot of) housing are socialized, and a public bank is used to interface with external market systems.

On top of this, a system of investment is defined for things that are difficult to account for via labor hours/incoming orders (such as software).

This whitepaper will describe the system itself, how it can be used, and the vision and goals behind it. It will do its best to avoid micromanaging what society should look like, instead seeking to become a foundation to build on top of.
