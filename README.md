# Basis paper

This is a huge work in progress. The original version of this project was built on top of a market system and called "regional socialism." It has close ties to mutualism and/or libertarian market socialism (probably). It can be found on [this git branch](https://gitlab.com/basisproject/whitepaper/tree/regional-socialism.market-model.v1) for those curious.

The current, in-progress version describes a system that provides the foundations of an economy based on the principles of the [free association of producers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_association_(Marxism_and_anarchism)) using an in-kind cost tracking system.

The idea behind the "free association of producers" is that money is abolished, and producers of goods and services render them to anyone they wish. All those who meet a social need, measured by their fulfillment of orders from other producers or consumers, are entitled to the output of the society. 

The idea behind "in-kind" calculation is that provided products (and services) will track all of the economic data associated with them. In other words if I order a banana from *The People's Banana Blowout Emporium*, I can see how much labor went into producing the banana, all the orders between producers that resulted in its creation, the fossil fuels used to ship it, the raw materials its production used, etc. This way, all economic information is transparent and accessible to both producers and consumers, allowing them to make much more informed decisions. The costing system's goal is to also provide information on scarcity (ie, "this bench uses 2 kg of iron ore, which given the current resource depletion rate, in conjunction with the recyclability of steel, will be completely depleted in 2090"). The ultimate goal is to associate *all* of the costs of production with its outputs, including externalities.

Basis manages a number of things:

- Companies
- Creation and updating of orders between producers (and between producers and consumers)
- Cost tracking
- Use of means of production
- Use of housing
- Collaborative management of social investment (such as building a bridge or hospital, or investing in ongoing automation research)

This paper will describe the system itself, how it can be used, and the vision and goals behind it. It will do its best to avoid micromanaging what society should look like, instead seeking to become a foundation to build on top of.

One of this project's main theories is that the idea of a global socialist revolution is too implausible to ever be realized, and that the revolution will instead happen through a small group of dedicated people creating a system which *incentivizes* a socialist mode of production naturally. Therefor, this project not only provides the management layer for this future society, but also provides a layer that allows it to effectively work *inside of* a market/capitalist system and grow outward from there. This compatibility layer will price goods and services similarly to capitalism (based on labor hours). Until money is abolished, it will also use several survival techniques to preserve its existence, the main one being its duality: members of the system will pay the at-cost (or subsidized) rate for all internal products and services while non-members will be charged at market rate, allowing for growth of the system (for buying more housing, office buildings, warehouses, factories, etc). This way, the system can grow peacefully, buying housing and means of production, until it reaches a critical mass that allows it to "shedt" its market compatibility layer, revealing its communist core.
