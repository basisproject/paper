# Basis paper

The goal of this paper is to give a high-level overview of the tools the Basis system offers and how they fit together. It does its best to avoid telling people *how* to use the tools, although some aspects are fixed (such as the costing system).

The current, in-progress version of this paper describes a system that provides the foundations of an economy based on the principles of the [free association of producers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_association_(Marxism_and_anarchism)) using an in-kind cost tracking system (where the labor and resource content of each product and service are tracked in detail, as opposed to obscuring them behind a price).

The idea behind the "free association of producers" is that money is abolished (at least in the productive sphere), and producers of goods and services render them to anyone they wish. All those who meet a social need, measured by their fulfillment of orders from other producers or consumers, are entitled to the output of the society. 

The idea behind "in-kind" calculation is that provided products and services will track all of the economic data associated with them. In other words if I order a banana from *The People's Banana Blowout Emporium*, I can see exactly how much labor (per-occupation) and resources (raw materials, fossil fuels, etc) went into producing the banana. Not only are costs tracked in disaggregate, but all the orders between producers that resulted in its creation are publicly viewable. This way, all economic information is transparent and accessible to both producers and consumers, allowing them to make much more informed decisions. The ultimate goal is to associate *as many* of the costs of production with its outputs, including externalities, while tracking resource usage and labor time.
