# Communist banking

The idea is that the bank creates a membrane: a cell well that allows interfacing with the market economy while shielding the members from the problems of the market. The market, and its products, would then be treated almost as a *natural resource*.

There are two models worth exploring.

## Moneyless

In this model, members don't work for any kind of traditional wage. The idea is if you're working some regionally-decided minimum number of hours, you're entitled to the social output.

Potential bonuses:

- Avoid tax problems?? Seems the regional bank would have all the tax liability and would shield the members.

Potential problems/concerns:

- *How much* of the social output are people entitled to?
  - What methods are put in place to limit intake?
  - Cultural education required: producers must feel a sense of ownership over their products such that they are able to best determine its usage. For instance, the producers of Ferraris might produce cars for a race track that rents cars out to members, but they might not produce cars for individuals (where the car will likely sit in a garage for 360 days out of the year)
  - Culture around lower costs?

## Labor vouchers

Potential problems/concerns:

- Taxes would be a concern.
- US labor law may prohibit paying people in "tokens" and may require money.
  - In this case, the definition of "employment" might mean something legally different in the system as opposed to the greater market.
