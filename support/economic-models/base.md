- currency is used
  - currency is a measure of societal value
  - stored electronically, all transactions go through conductor
    - the idea is to make it expensive to make secondary markets
    - direct transfers impossible, must be buying goods or services
      - see "services" section

- equations:
  - ProfessionHours: (hours worked) * StressIndex * SocialNeed
    - StressIndex: mental + physical stress
    - SocialNeed: NEED teachers. NEED construction. we don't NEED dildos (well, i do, most people don't)
    - values determined per-profession, per-region
  - ProductivityRate: determines a person's productivity
    - based on industry average (ranges from 0 to 2, 1 being average)
      - range can be variable regionally
    - NOTE: this would be HEAVILY per-industry influenced and nuanced
      - ex: can a dr's productivity be measured by "patients per hour"?
        - would incentivize bad behavior
      - programmers were measured in the past by lines of code
    - might need to be based on mutual workplace agreements and quarterly peer evaluation
  - BaseSalary: ProfessionHours * ProductivityRate
  - CostOfEducation:
    - Reschooling for market shifts should not be penalized
      - education scarcity to decentivize overschooling
    - Simplified: easier to track, averages costs
      - For each day:
        - (CostOfLabor + Maintenance) / TotalStudents
          - CostOfLabor: the labor cost of all staff summed (teachers, administrative, janitorial, IT, etc)
          - Maintenance: supplies/equipment
            - light bulbs
            - boiler room shit
            - cleaning supplies
            - etc
          - basically average the cost of running the entire school, per-day, over each student (daily)
    - Exact: requires specific student/teacher tracking (good luck)
      - For each day:
        - TeacherHoursPerStudent + (Mainenance / TotalStudents)
          - TeacherHoursPerStuden:
            - for each teacher student has
              - CostOfSkilledLabor * (hours spent with student)
          - Maintenance:
            - for each enrolled hour (eg, 4 years would be 365 * 24 * 4 = 35040)
              - labor hours (skilled or unskilled) of all maintenance staff
                - janitorial
                - electrician
                - IT
          - TotalStudents:
            - on any given day, how many students are enrolled
  - EducationVesting: A value starting at N and approaching 1 (linearly) over H hours as education is payed back
    - Min(N + (((hours worked) / H) * (1 - N)), 1)
      - 0 < N <= 1
      - 1 < D <= Infinity
    - N / Y set per-region/per-industry
    - company pays salary as worker sees it (worker pays off education to state via reduced labor cost)
      - cheaper to hire workers out of school
      - more expensive to retain/hire seasoned workers
      - requires careful tuning of vesting schedule/rate values
        - want to not create artificial market for hiring fresh meat and/or firing veterans
        - also want to penalize workers for shifting careers too early
        - balanced N value
  - Salary: (BaseSalary * EducationVesting)
      - ProductivityRate: 0.1 <= x <= 2
        - Collectively-decided measure of a worker's productivity based on industry standard (1 being average)

- banking/investment
  - controls allocation of regional capital into new ventures
  - coordinates regionally-owned means of production
    - tracks inventory
    - responsible for maintenance
  - democratic/local control (board)
    - size ranges from 1-N in odd numbers
      - based on population?
    - votes on funding regional businesses
  - allows community control of investment

- conductor base functions
  - regional/state payment processor
    - decentralized via cryptocurrency
    - pseudanonymous
  - regional/state job/product market
    - available jobs listed
    - products listed (capital and consumer)
    - shipping companies/methods listed
  - cost tracking: all resources/work for each product are calculated:
    - raw material costs (owned by state or via foreign trade)
    - labor hours
    - shipping

- how is global trade operated?
  - trade companies buy foreign products at the exchange rate of the currency
  - the "cost" of the products (to society, not the price sold) is the exact $$ amount used to purchase/ship
    - foreign exchanges have exchange rates set (per-currency or across the board) via planning

- federate on the company level? or region level?
  - probably region (city/municipality), right?

- job markets
  - companies have listings on conductor for positions
  - companies interview and hire the best candidates
  - self-employment is an option
    - all transactions go through conductor
      - enforces payment via labor-hours (see salary)

- production company modeling
  - anybody can start a company
    - ask regional bank for a loan, must show there is a market
      - if approved, company can "rent" factory space (see "equipment rental")
      - if strong market is shown, company can "rent" land and build a factory/storefront

- workforce
  - every worker paid salary while working
    - see "equations.salary"
  - measure cost based not just on labor hours, but the societal cost of education
    - (CostOfEducation / years productive) * (ProfessionHours * ProductivityRate)
      - CostOfEducation: factors in all the skilled/unskilled labor hours to educate
        - recursive? must have dampening to avoid infinite looping
      - given the above, new workers are MUCH more expensive to society than old ones.
        - perhaps this should be taken into account in salary for *skilled workers*
    - EducationPayback: At some point a person has payed back their education completely?
      - at this point EducationVesting in salary equation should be 1
      - also at this point, if they are a teacher, CostOfEducation 
  - education cost per student
    - cost of teacher hours (skill
  - can't work (injury/brain condition/etc)
    - pay them low-level salary?
  - don't want to work
    - some acceptable buffer of non-productive population
      - EUTHENIZATION jkjkjk
      - SJW CUCKS
      - ??

- housing
  - state-owned
  - like equipment, state charges rent
  - land can be purchased from state
    - house can be built on purchased land
  - house can be sold back to state at market value
    - market value is determined via yearly assessment
  - house can be bought from state at market value
    - state bank issues loans
  - apartments owned by state
    - rent is cost of operating the building
  - is it "free" or does it take credits?
  - houses for non-working?
    - probably, low end, or shelters with food (see "don't want to work")

- equipment rental
  - WIP
  - all means of production owned by community/region
    - trucks
    - factories
    - machines
    - etc (anything a "company" owns is owned by local public)
  - everything used is rented from region

- regional coordination
  - WIP
  - allow creation of pools of capital that coordinating regions can spend from
  - examples:
    - road spanning multiple regions
    - public transit
    - bridge over body of water between two regions

- unknowns / WIP:
  - secondary/black markets
    - people paying each other directly or exchanging gifts
      - does this matter? black market would have to pay more than worker salary
    - possibility of exploitation?
    - foreign money as a means of exchange
      - heavy taxes on foreign -> local currency exchanges?
  - working from home/running company from home
    - only a problem IF companies do not have profit and do not pay workers from company pool
